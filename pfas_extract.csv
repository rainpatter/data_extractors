Minor amounts may escape during recharging of fire extinguishing systems, but economic considerations would be expected to minimise such losses.",,,,,"concentrations over 9.7% but no greater than 10.5%.  A maximum of 30 seconds is recommended for concentrations greater than 10% but less than 14%.; High temperature incineration is recommended for any HFC-227ea that requires disposal.  This would need to be preceded by export as such facilities do not exist currently in Australia.  However, such situations are not expected to arise under normal use conditions, as economic considerations will favour recovery.","Data for flash point, flammability limits, explosive properties and autoignition temperature were not provided.  These data were not required for the notified chemical as it possesses fire-extinguishing properties.  Upon exposure to a flame or a hot surface >700°C, the notified chemical will decompose to hydrogen fluoride and other toxic or irritating vapours (2).; Additives/Adjuvants: nitrogen gas (CAS No 7727-37-9); weight percentage will vary with pressure requirements of firefighting system; HFC-227ea will not be manufactured in Australia.  The chemical will be imported in pressurised, ready to use containers or tanks and used as a replacement gas for Halon 1301 in total flooding fire-extinguishing systems.  The notified chemical extinguishes fires by physically cooling the fuel and by the production of free radicals during decomposition which interfere with the combustion process.; Total flooding fire extinguishing systems are used in contained areas to protect such equipment as computer rooms and telecommunications switching facilities, oil production facilities, records storage facilities, aircraft cargo bays, flammable liquid storage facilities and laboratories, and public areas such as libraries, museums, shopping malls and tourist facilities.  HFC-227ea is proposed to be used in industrial applications only, with typical firefighting applications involving dry electrical hazards, such as switching equipment, computer hardware and electrical circuits.  It is estimated that 50 tonnes will be imported in the first year increasing to 150 tonnes by the fifth year.; As the notified chemical will be imported and distributed in pressurised containers or tanks (0.5 to 10 tonnes), exposure during transport should result only in the event of handling accidents.  The types of workers likely to be exposed in these situations include dock workers, warehouse workers, transport drivers, police and rescue personnel as well as firefighters.; During servicing and recharging of fire systems, installation fitters and maintenance personnel may be exposed to the chemical in the event of leakages of compressed gas from the tanks.  The notifier has indicated, however, that leakages should be minor, and workers will wear appropriate gloves and goggles during servicing of the equipment to avoid cold burns.; The greatest potential for exposure will be during firefighting procedures.  The notified chemical will be used in total flooding systems installed in fixed enclosures.  The extent of exposure during firefighting will be entirely dependent on the number of fire emergencies and the materials fuelling the fires.; In order for the gas to be effective as a fire extinguisher, it will be used and maintained at a concentration of at least 5.8% (3).  Concentrations will generally be between 7 and 9% but may reach levels greater than 14%.; Use of HFC-227ea will entail inevitable atmospheric release in the case of fire.  Minor amounts may escape during recharging of fire extinguishing systems, but economic considerations would be expected to minimise such losses.; Animal studies indicate that HFC-227ea may potentiate the effects of adrenalin at and above 9%.  In an emergency fire situation workers will have elevated blood adrenalin levels, while some workers may also be taking sympathomimetic agents such as bronchodilators or cold medications.  As a result, these workers will be at risk of cardiac effects (such as cardiac arrhythmia) if exposed to ≥9% concentration of HFC-227ea.  At higher concentrations, there is a risk the notified chemical may displace oxygen in the breathing mixture resulting in oxygen deprivation and possibly death.  Workers exposed to the gas during a fire will also be at risk of exposure to corrosive and/or toxic thermal decomposition products, such as hydrogen fluoride.  In the application for extension, the potential for maternal and developmental toxicity of the notified chemical was evaluated using pregnant rabbits and rats.  There was no maternal or developmental toxicity observed at any dose concentration tested.  The no observable adverse effect level (NOAEL) in both studies was determined to be 731.69 mg/L (105 000 ppm), 6 hr/day.  In a 90-day inhalation repeat-dose study, NOAEL for systemic toxicity was found to be 731.69 mg/L (105 000 ppm), 6 hr/day.; Under normal use conditions, however, all personnel will be evacuated before the firefighting systems are started, and workers will be required to wear adequate personal protective devices if exposure is anticipated.  As a result the risk to workers should be minimal.; During servicing of the fire suppression systems, gas may escape from pressurised tanks.  In these situations the expanding gas may cause 'cold burns' if it contacts the skin.  With appropriate personal protective equipment, the risk will be minimal.; • Restrictions on discharge of halons, except in the case of fire, should be retained for HFC-227ea as it has significant global warming potential.  This should be reflected in the Draft Standard for FM-200 (HFC-227ea) Total Flooding Fire Suppression Systems, which currently (revision of 1 December 1993) specifies that HFC-227ea shall be the test medium for any discharge testing that may occur.; 2.

NA626,The notified chemical will not be manufactured or reformulated in Australia but will be imported in 20 L drums made of mild steel. The notifier estimates that less than 20 tonnes per year of the notified chemical will be imported  in the  first  two  years  and less than 10 tonnes per year in the next three years.,,,It is therefore important that the use of HFC 43-10mee in vapour degreasing is well- controlled. Compliance with the AFCAM Code of Practice and the relevant Australian standards is essential to reduce inhalation and dermal exposure and consequently reduce health risks from exposure to the notified chemical.  Only under these circumstances is the,,"Guidance material for the safe handling of the notified chemical was provided by the notifier, namely Safe Handling of Vertrel Cleaning Agents (DuPont 1996) and Vertrel Cleaning Agents – Recommended Work Practices (DuPont 1996).; Therefore, the risk of adverse health effects from acute inhalation exposure is largely confined to the frequency and duration of exposure to spills and leaks, particularly in confined areas, where high vapour concentrations may develop. This may include cleaning and maintenance activities. It is therefore recommended that respiratory equipment be available for use when required. Atmospheric monitoring during non-routine activities should also be considered, e.g. during cleaning and maintenance of degreaser tanks.; This assessment indicates that HFC 43-10mee needs to be referred to the NOHSC Hazardous Substances Sub-committee for consideration of an exposure standard. In the meantime, exposure to the notified chemical should be maintained well below the notifier’s recommended Acceptable Exposure Limit (AEL) of 200 ppm TWA (8- and 12-hour) and 400 ppm Ceiling Limit.; notifier’s recommended Acceptable Exposure Limit (AEL) of 200 ppm TWA (8- and 12-hour) and 400 ppm Ceiling Limit.; 2. Due to the current lack of exposure data and uncertainty about the validity of the notifier’s exposure limits, it is recommended that a regular program of atmospheric monitoring be introduced to monitor the personal exposure of vapour degreaser operators. Both instantaneous and time-weighted average (over the full shift) measurements should be made. This data may need to be made available to the NOHSC Hazardous Substances Sub-committee at a later date.; DuPont (1996). Vertrel Cleaning Agents - Recommended Work Practices, Product Information.",
NA651,"The notified polymer confers water and oil repellent properties and will be used for finishing and protection of textiles. Some of the applications for the final textile products may include leather goods, raincoats, tents, tablecloths and carpets.","The acute toxicity of Foraperle 225 is low. It is a slight irritant to the skin of rabbits. It was found to be a moderate irritant to the eyes of rabbits. Based on the results of this study, classification of Foraperle 225 as a persistent eye irritant (R41) is warranted, and therefore the notified polymer also needs to be classified with the risk phrase R41. The skin sensitisation study in guinea pigs was found to be inconclusive due to the skin reactions in the control animals. As acrylates tend to be skin sensitisers, it is recommended that dermal exposure be avoided.","Under the Act, secondary notification under Section 64(1) is required if additional skin sensitisation studies or health effects information,  including sensitising effects, becomes available for this or other similar perfluoroalkyl acrylate polymer. In addition, secondary notification of the notified chemical shall be required if any of the circumstances stipulated under subsection 64(2) of the Act arise. No other specific conditions are prescribed.",,,"The acute toxicity of Foraperle 225 is low. It is a slight irritant to the skin of rabbits.

The skin sensitisation study in guinea pigs was found to be inconclusive due to the skin reactions in the control animals. As acrylates tend to be skin sensitisers, it is recommended that dermal exposure be avoided.; Waterproofing Application It is likely that the application of the commercial waterproofing product will be a small scale industrial process as well as a home operation. Workers applying the aerosol waterproofing formulation would be exposed to the notified chemical on a much more regular basis than the general public. For workers so engaged, dermal, ocular and inhalation exposure are probable in the absence of protective measures. At the low concentration, the risk of adverse health effects, apart from eye irritation, due to the notified polymer is expected to be low. During aerosol use there is also a risk of skin and eye irritant effects resulting from other ingredients in the product. It is recommended that any workers using the commercial waterproofing product work in a well ventilated area and use gloves and safety glasses for protection.","At the customer site the aerosol can filling operation is carried out under local exhaust and general ventilation. As aerosols are Dangerous Goods, these processes are carried out in purpose built areas with appropriate fire proofing and bunding. Workers will wear overalls, safety boots, safety glasses and gloves."
NA46,,"Haloalkane gases in the atmosphere can also increase the greenhouse effect by restricting heat loss from the Earth's atmosphere through absorbing infrared emissions from the surface. The main greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide and water vapour, but their infrared spectra leave an atmospheric window between 8 and 12 mm. Leaving aside possible feedback mechanisms, such as cloud formation, gases absorbing in this window will warm the Earth's atmosphere. Perfluoropropane absorbs strongly in the middle of this spectral band and has a very long atmospheric lifetime, both of which are undesirable properties from the perspective of global warming. However, the wavelengths and intensities of this and other infrared absorptions in the window do not differ significantly from those of the highly persistent CFC-115 (C2F5Cl), which perfluoropropane will replace. Thus the transition to perfluoropropane containing refrigerants would not be expected to significantly increase the direct global warming potential of the atmosphere. However, as ozone is a greenhouse gas, substitution of the ozone depleting CFC-115 by perfluoropropane will introduce an inevitable greenhouse penalty associated with restoration of the stratospheric ozone layer.; The principal hazard is likely to be to the atmosphere, as the notified substance absorbs infrared radiation strongly between 8 and 12 mm and is predicted to be very persistent in the atmosphere. Accordingly, perfluoropropane would be expected to contribute to global warming if released to the environment. However, these properties also characterise CFC-115, which it will replace, and an increased global warming hazard from the transition is not apparent. In the interest of risk reduction, such persistent substances should be replaced by others of lesser persistence at the earliest opportunity, and the notifier has indicated an intention to use perfluoropropane as an interim replacement while awaiting the completion of toxicity testing requirements for HFC replacements.; . that Rhone-Poulenc make every effort to expedite the transition to less environmentally persistent refrigerants;","perfluoropropane; perfluoropropane; Other name(s): perfluoropropane, octafluoropropane, fluorocarbon 218, (FC-218), R218; Methods of Detection and determination Perfluoropropane may be identified by infrared spectrophotometry and gas chromatography.; Flammability: perfluorocarbons are nonflammable. Concentrations of 10% perfluoropropane have been demonstrated to be extinguishants.; function of pH and known stability of perfluoroalkanes.; Flash Point, flammability Limits, autoignition temperature and explosive properties were not determined. Perfluoroalkanes are nonflammable and possess fire extinguishing properties. Perfluoropropane has been tested as a component of a non- combustible atmosphere and found to suppress combustion of ignited materials (2). However, some hydrogen fluoride was formed during the process and other toxic or irritating fumes may be formed.; Perfluoropropane will not be manufactured in Australia. It will be imported in pressurised containers as a constituent of a refrigerant gas mixtures. The chemical is listed on the EEC Inventory 'EINECS' and the United States Inventory. Anecdotal evidence overseas over a period of years has been stated to show no adverse effects.; According to the notifier, perfluoropropane has been used commercially outside Australia for plasma etching in the electronics industry for at least 10 years. It has also been proposed as a halon replacement in total flooding applications (3).; Perfluoropropane will be used as a component in a refrigerant gas. Workers exposed will include airconditioning and refrigeration engineers and maintenance personnel working on; The potential for public exposure to perfluoropropane is low. Although the compound is a gas at ambient temperatures with a high vapour pressure, it is one constituent of a near azeotropic mix to be used as a refrigerant within sealed refrigerator systems. It appears from the information provided that the use of perfluoropropane within the near azeotropic mix is restricted to commercial usage eg. transport refrigeration, supermarket display cabinets.; Perfluoropropane will be used as a component of a refrigerant gas, mainly in supermarkets, with smaller amounts in such applications as low temperature display cabinets, refrigerated transport, cold stores and environmental test chambers. It would appear that household appliances are unlikely to be refilled with the new refrigerant. This latter category of appliance presents the most difficulties when it comes to recovery of unwanted refrigerants.; Isceon 69L, containing perfluoropropane, is said to be a direct drop in replacement for R-502 [a mixture of CFC-115 (CF3CF2Cl) and HCFC-22 (CHClF2)] which will require no modification to existing equipment.; However, losses of refrigerants containing perfluoropropane are expected to be much lower as their high cost will provide a financial incentive to invest in leak detection equipment, and to improve service practices generally.; Global production of CFC-11 (CFCl3), CFC-12 (CF2Cl2) and CFC-113 (CCl2FCClF2) peaked at more than 1 000 000 tonnes in 1985, with most of the CFCs produced eventually escaping into the environment to accumulate in the atmosphere, if not used as chemical intermediates (5). However, awareness of the environmental hazard posed by CFCs has prompted the introduction of extensive measures to contain them. Rhone-Poulenc operates a policy of recovery and reclamation of refrigerants through local suppliers, which will allow purchasers of perfluoropropane containing gases to voluntarily return their current ozone depleting refrigerants, and eventually the replacements, to the UK. No charge is levied for this service, apart from a small rental charge for cylinders in which to collect the refrigerants. Recovery of ozone depleting refrigerants is mandatory in most States. As noted above, the high cost of perfluoropropane may also discourage its release into the atmosphere and favour recovery. On the question of disposal, the notifier indicates that any venting to the atmosphere of small quantities of Isceon refrigerants should only take place if reclamation is not feasible. Larger amounts should be incinerated at an approved facility with fluoride scrubbers.; Given the high volatility, low water solubility and chemical stability of perfluoropropane, any releases to the environment will partition almost entirely to the atmosphere. The high stability and spectral characteristics of perfluoropropane mean that, like the fully halogenated CFCs, it is unlikely to degrade until it diffuses to the stratosphere. Photolysis tends to occur at lower altitudes for more heavily chlorinated CFCs, which thus have shorter lifetimes. Accordingly, the atmospheric residence time of perfluoropropane is likely to be of similar magnitude to those for the longer lived CFCs eg CF3Cl, 400 years and C2F5Cl, 380 years (5). Lifetimes in excess of 10 000 years have been assigned to perfluoromethane and perfluorethane (6) but these appear to be an overestimate, particularly for the latter. Photolysis of perfluoroethane and perfluoropropane should proceed more readily because of the availability of a C-C bond, which is; weaker than a C-F bond, and this prediction is supported by the observation (6) that perfluoroethane yields roughly twice as many trifluoromethyl radicals as perfluoromethane in mass spectral analysis.; Degradation of perfluoropropane is expected to proceed via cleavage of the carbon backbone under the influence of ultraviolet radiation in the stratosphere to form perfluoroalkyl radicals in the first instance. Thus perfluoropropane will provide an additional source of such radicals to those currently present in the stratosphere, such as CF3Cl and C2F5Cl.; In conclusion, perfluoropropane is expected to undergo photochemically induced degradation in the stratosphere at; The notifier requested a variation of the Schedule requirements. Data on oral or dermal toxicity could not be submitted on this gas. No specific tests of skin or eye irritation or of skin sensitisation could be submitted. However, data on irritation can be gained from the acute and short term, repeated dose inhalation studies, the mouse micronucleus study and a report of the injection of perfluoropropane into the vitreous humour of the rabbit eye.; The acute inhalational toxicity of perfluoropropane was assessed in ten male Sprague Dawley albino rats receiving a concentration of 80% perfluoropropane and 20% oxygen in the breathing mixture. Controls received air. Animals were exposed for a period of one hour and monitored for a fourteen day period post exposure. Chamber concentrations of the test gas were monitored continuously during exposure.; No deaths occurred during the study. All animals receiving perfluoropropane exhibited initial hyperactivity, later decreased activity, redness of the skin and closed eyes. Growth curves were considered normal.; Perfluoropropane was considered to show no acute toxicity on inhalation of concentrations up to 80%.; An abstract (9) of a report of injection of perfluorocarbons into the rabbit eye showed that perfluoropropane noted that there was 'No evidence of damage to the membrane or subcellular damage to the retina.'; Fluorocarbons have been reported to sensitise the myocardium to the effects of sympathomimetic amines or to have a direct arrhythmic induction capacity. A translation of a comprehensive literature review (10) was included in the submission. No specific information on the cardiotoxicity of perfluoropropane was included nor was any found in the recent scientific literature.; The inhalational toxicity of perfluoropropane was assessed in parallel studies in two species (2), investigating the toxicity of several fluorocarbons using identical methodology. The study was carried out in the early 1970's with the standards of laboratory practice and reporting of the time. Test animals used were not pathogen free.; Groups of ten male and ten female rats and ten male and ten female guinea pigs were exposed to concentrations of approx 10% perfluoropropane in air for 24 hours/day over a ten day period. The breathing mixture was recirculated, carbon dioxide and moisture removed and oxygen added to maintain oxygen content at 20%. Control groups of ten male and ten female rats and ten male and ten female guinea pigs received room air. Concentrations of perfluoropropane were monitored by infra red spectrophotometry, confirmed by gas chromatography. Mean actual concentrations over the ten day study period were 11.3%, range 8.5% - 13.7%.; At necropsy, four male and six female rats in the control group had red and brown discolouration of areas of the lungs; four males and nine females receiving perfluoropropane had areas of red, brown and grey discolouration of the lungs. (Rats in other test groups also had discolouration of the lungs at necropsy.) Histopathology showed a high incidence of interstitial pneumonitis with perivascular and/or peribronchial infiltrate in control and in all test groups. There was an increased incidence of lymphocytic infiltrate in liver in the test group (from 7/10 to 10/10). Foci of necrosis were present in the liver of four test animals but not controls.; All female guinea pigs and eight male guinea pigs receiving 10% perfluoropropane appeared normal during the study. Two males receiving perfluoropropane and one control male appeared to be; The ratio of liver and adrenal weights/body weight was significantly increased in females. Histopathological examination revealed interstitial pneumonitis in all control animals and in all test animals treated with perfluoropropane or other perfluorocarbons. Focal necrosis was observed in the livers of 5/10 examined test animals compared to 3/10 examined control animals.; The mutagenic potential of perfluoropropane was determined in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA 1535, TA 1537, TA 1538, TA 98, TA 100. Two independent studies were conducted in the presence and absence of metabolic activation.; Bacteria were exposed by incubating plates overnight in a sealed desiccator with known concentrations of perfluoropropane and then incubated for two days in air. Concentrations of up to 80% of the test gas were found not to be bacteriotoxic. Concentrations of 80, 40, 20, 10 and 5% were therefore used for the test. S-9 mix was used as the metabolic activator. Air was used as a negative control. Positive controls were run by addition of known concentrations of the appropriate chemical to a plate followed by incubation for three days:; All positive controls showed an increase in revertant colonies compared to the negative control. No increase was noted with any concentration of perfluoropropane. Perfluoropropane was not found to be mutagenic against Salmonella typhimurium in this test.; 9.3.2 Effect of perfluoropropane on E coli (12,13); Published reports were submitted of studies in which E coli 417, E coli B and E coli K12 were exposed to various gases including perfluoropropane. Preliminary studies showed perfluoropropane had some bacteriotoxic action and that on bubbling perfluoropropane through a series of incubation media there was a progressive decrease in bacteriotoxic effect. Gases were bubbled through the incubation mixture for ten minutes, the container; sealed and the suspensions incubated at 25oC for 24 hours. Penicillin selection was used to determine perfluoropropane- induced forward mutation from prototrophy to auxotrophy. Penicillin survival increased about 100-fold after gas treatment and this was interpreted as an increase in the mutation rate. However, no biochemical mutants were found after testing individual surviving colonies and, although it was claimed that pronounced changes in carbohydrate metabolism were induced by the gases, only a small effect on mannitol fermentation was observed in the perfluoropropane treated cells. It is unlikely that a true mutagen would exhibit this level of specificity and the results are not inconsistent with the negative Ames test.; Groups of 15 male and 15 female SD1 SPF outbred mice were exposed to a breathing mixture of 8O% perfluoropropane with 20% oxygen for a period of six hours. A negative control group were housed under similar conditions and received air. Positive controls were treated with Mitomycin C, 12 mg/kg in aqueous 0.9% saline by gavage.; Positive controls showed an increased numbers of MNNs/1000 PCEs. Mice treated with perfluoropropane did not show any increase in numbers of MNNs or in the ratio of PCEs/NCEs.; Perfluoropropane did not cause chromosome damage in this test, nor was there any evidence of irritant potential.; Perfluoropropane showed little acute toxicity to the rat or the mouse (micronucleus study) at extremely high concentrations (80%). It was not mutagenic against Salmonella typhimurium nor did it cause an increase in micronuclei formation in the mouse micronucleus test.; noted as having reddened skin and 'closed eyes'. No specific comment on the irritation potential was made in the reports of the ten day inhalation study and the mouse micronucleus study. No suspicious symptoms were reported in either study. An abstract of a report of injection of perfluoropropane into the rabbit eye reported no membrane or subcellular damage. It can be concluded that perfluoropropane is a non-irritant for practical purposes.; Although there is no specific information on the cardiotoxicity of perfluoropropane, the chemical should be regarded as potentially cardiotoxic with sudden exposure to high concentrations.; Effects on organisms are not expected as the notified substance, like other perfluoroalkanes, is chemically and biologically inert. Apart from ozone depletion and possible greenhouse warming, there is no evidence available for any direct ecological effects from the fully halogenated chlorofluoromethanes and ethanes (5), and perfluoropropane would not be expected to depart from this low ecotoxicological profile.; The notifier submitted aquatic toxicity test reports for the analogous compound perfluoroperhydrofluorene. No toxic effects were noted at the highest concentrations tested (100 ppm for rainbow trout and 0.1 ppm for daphnids). The latter test is uninformative as it was hampered by poor water solubility and toxicity of the dispersing agent to daphnids. However, exposure of aquatic organisms appears unlikely, except transiently in the case of spills, because of the high volatility of perfluoropropane. This volatility also renders aquatic toxicity testing difficult.; bromine atoms in the atmosphere. As noted above, they may also release fluorine atoms, but these are not considered to give rise to ozone depletion because of their much higher electronegativity and consequent affinity for hydrogen. Perfluoropropane contains neither chlorine nor bromine, and thus has zero ozone depletion potential.; Haloalkane gases in the atmosphere can also increase the greenhouse effect by restricting heat loss from the Earth's atmosphere through absorbing infrared emissions from the surface. The main greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide and water vapour, but their infrared spectra leave an atmospheric window between 8 and 12 mm. Leaving aside possible feedback mechanisms, such as cloud formation, gases absorbing in this window will warm the Earth's atmosphere. Perfluoropropane absorbs strongly in the middle of this spectral band and has a very long atmospheric lifetime, both of which are undesirable properties from the perspective of global warming. However, the wavelengths and intensities of this and other infrared absorptions in the window do not differ significantly from those of the highly persistent CFC-115 (C2F5Cl), which perfluoropropane will replace. Thus the transition to perfluoropropane containing refrigerants would not be expected to significantly increase the direct global warming potential of the atmosphere. However, as ozone is a greenhouse gas, substitution of the ozone depleting CFC-115 by perfluoropropane will introduce an inevitable greenhouse penalty associated with restoration of the stratospheric ozone layer.; The notifier assumes a lifetime of 1 000 years to calculate as a ""worst case"" that perfluoropropane has a global warming potential (GWP) after 100 years time integration of 1.73 x 104 (relative to carbon dioxide with GWP 1.0). This is approximately double the reported GWPs of perfluoromethane and perfluoroethane (15). While this appears to indicate an increased global warming hazard, it should be noted that considerable uncertainty surrounds the calculation of GWP, especially regarding indirect effects. Accordingly, the above numerical estimates must be regarded as approximate and therefore not significantly different in magnitude. In addition, other global warming impacts from refrigeration particularly energy consumption, are likely to outweigh any direct impact from the refrigant.; Perfluoropropane is not expected to exert a direct effect on living organisms as it is chemically stable and biologically inactive. The high volatility should ensure minimal exposure of aquatic and terrestrial compartments.; The principal hazard is likely to be to the atmosphere, as the notified substance absorbs infrared radiation strongly between 8 and 12 mm and is predicted to be very persistent in the atmosphere. Accordingly, perfluoropropane would be expected to contribute to global warming if released to the environment. However, these properties also characterise CFC-115, which it will replace, and an increased global warming hazard from the transition is not apparent. In the interest of risk reduction, such persistent substances should be replaced by others of lesser persistence at the earliest opportunity, and the notifier has indicated an intention to use perfluoropropane as an interim replacement while awaiting the completion of toxicity testing requirements for HFC replacements.; The notifier has indicated that safeguards are in place to minimise release of refrigerants containing perfluoropropane, and these safeguards are reinforced by the legislative requirement in most States for mandatory recycling of ozone depleting gases and the high replacement cost should losses occur. The proposed refrigerants containing perfluoropropane will be difficult to fractionate into their various components for reuse and will have to be destroyed, probably by high temperature incineration, when the HFC containing replacements become available.; The potential for public exposure to perfluoropropane is low. It is one constituent of a azeotropic mix to be used as a 'drop-in' replacement refrigerant in existing refrigerator systems. It is present therefore, in sealed refrigerator systems restricted to commercial usage.; Perfluoropropane is not manufactured in Australia. It will be imported as an ingredient of a formulated gas in pressurised containers. Contact with the liquid will cause 'cold burns' as; At extreme concentrations, perfluoropropane may displace oxygen in the breathing mixture with resultant oxygen deprivation. The gas is denser than air and care must be taken to avoid accumulation in confined or low-lying spaces.; Perfluoropropane is an extinguishant and is not flammable. However, at temperatures which may occur in a fire, it will form toxic or irritant fumes, including hydrogen fluoride. Localised sources (eg welding, smoking) of high temperature in the breathing zone should be avoided where possible. Fire services should wear appropriate protective clothing. The pressurised tanks should be sprayed with water to avoid heat expansion and over-pressurisation leading to rupture of the tank.; Perfluoropropane may potentiate sympathomimetics. As a precaution, those workers taking sympathomimetic agents such as bronchodilators or cold medications should have their medication reassessed to ensure that the prescribed agent has minimal cardiac effects, unless this is medically inappropriate. Workers receiving sympathomimetics and those taking over-the-counter cough and cold preparations should take extra precautions to avoid inhalational exposure. Doctors treating hypoxia or any case after overexposure to this (or any other) fluorocarbon should not administer adrenaline or other sympathomimetic amine stimulants.; The following guidelines and precautions should be observed when using perfluoropropane:; . as good housekeeping practice, areas where perfluoropropane is vented or may escape should have good general ventilation or local exhaust ventilation.; . physicians treating a patient after exposure to high concentrations of perfluoropropane should not administer adrenaline or other sympathomimetic amine stimulants.; Release of perfluoropropane into the atmosphere must be minimised. As it will be used in a blend with ozone depleting substances, this can be achieved through the mandatory recycling requirements for ozone depleting gases existing under State legislation, which must be rigourously policed and enforced. As further safeguards we recommend:; . that Rhone-Poulenc introduce the recycling technology currently used in the UK for refrigerants containing perfluoropropane into Australia at the earliest opportunity;; . that Rhone-Poulenc provide yearly information to the Commonwealth Environmental Protection Agency (CEPA) through the Director, Chemicals Notification and Assessment on amounts of perfluoropropane imported into or used in Australia; and; . that Rhone-Poulenc bring any adverse findings related to the use of perfluoropropane to the immediate attention of the Director of Chemicals Notification and Assessment.; Attached to this Full Public Report is a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for the the refrigerant gas containing perfluoropropane. This MSDS was provided by Rhone Poulenc Chemicals Pty Ltd as part of their notification statement. It is reproduced here as a matter of public record. However the accuracy of this information remains the responsibility of Rhone Poulenc Chemicals Pty Ltd.; Under the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Act 1989 (the Act), secondary notification of perfluoropropane shall be required if any of the circumstances stipulated under subsection 64(2) of the Act arise.

NA588,,"Although not required under the Act, the notifier has supplied a study of the biodegradability of the polymer (in French with some English translation). The biodegradability of the notified polymer was investigated in accordance with OECD test guideline 301A (Modified AFNOR test). During the test, 100% disappearance of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was observed within five days of the commencement of the test. This result was taken to indicate the substance is readily biodegradable under the conditions of the test, suggesting that the perfluorinated part of the molecule also degrades rapidly. However, Remde and Debus [Remde A and Debus R, 1996 #221] were not able to establish the fate of fluorinated moieties in the biodegradation of three different fluorinated surfactants investigated. They concluded that in all cases, the formation of a highly fluorinated water insoluble fragment with unknown toxicity could not be ruled out (even when one was readily degraded), and it is likely that the fluorocarbon portion will be persistent.",,"Additionally, the observed disappearance of the DOC may also be accounted for by the adsorption of the polymer to the sludge during the test (see above). This would also be consistent with the fact that a polymer of this type with its relatively high molecular weight would be unlikely to degrade completely within 5 days [Nabholtz, 1997 #223]. The vast majority of synthetic polymers are essentially nonbiodegradeable, and the assessment of the removal of polymers in wastewater treatment essentially reduces to an assessment of removal by sorption and/or precipitation [Remde A and Debus R, 1996 #221]. As noted above, the USEPA assumes that for cationic polymers 90% of the influent concentration of a cationic polymer will be removed by passage through a waste water treatment plant, and the remaining 10% is assumed to be discharged to receiving waters [Remde A and Debus R, 1996 #221]. The high molecular weight, water solubility (and consequential likely low partition coefficient) and ionic nature of the chemical would indicate that the chemical is unlikely to bioaccumulate [Connell DW, 1989 #3].",,,

Import volumes in the first five years will be up to 500 kg per annum.  The product containing the notified polymer is expected to be sold directly to customers for reformulation and to be used for emergency situations such as fire-fighting.,"The biodegradability of the notified polymer was investigated in accordance with OECD test guideline 301D (Closed Bottle Test). During the test, 11%, 66% and 90% biodegradation [Biological oxygen demand (BOD) expressed as a percentage of the chemical oxygen demand (COD)] was observed after 5, 15 and 28 days, respectively (1). The results indicate the substance is readily biodegradable under the conditions of the test. This suggests that the perfluorinated part of the molecule degrades rapidly. However,  Remde and Debus (2) were not able to establish the fate of fluorinated moieties in the biodegradation of three different fluorinated surfactants investigated. They concluded that in all cases the formation of a highly fluorinated water insoluble fragment with unknown toxicity could not be ruled out (even when one was readily degraded), and it is likely that the fluorocarbon portion will be persistent.","The notified chemical consists of a mixture of congeners with varying length of perfluoroalkyl chains (C4-8). The potential for bioaccumulation of these congeners has not been investigated. The molecular weight of the congeners and the high proportion of carbon-fluorine bonds is consistent with a high capacity for bioaccumulation. However, the high water solubility (and consequential likely low partition coefficient) and ionic nature of the chemical would indicate that the chemical is unlikely to bioaccumulate (3)",,,"The notified chemical will be used as a surface acting agent in fire fighting foam to be used by fire-fighters.  Minimal public exposure may result following contact with accidental spills or following use as a fire-fighting foam.

The probability of public exposure is minimised by the recommended practices during storage and transportation.","The notified chemical is intended to be used as a surface active agent in fire fighting foam.  It will not be manufactured in Australia but will be imported as a component of Lodyne S-152B at a concentration of less than 10%.  Import volumes in the first five years will be up to 500 kg per annum.  The product containing the notified polymer is expected to be sold directly to customers for reformulation and to be used for emergency situations such as fire-fighting.; At the sites of use, the reformulated product will be handled by fire fighters.  The product will be further diluted  (0.015 to 0.009% notified chemical) in stream use during fire fighting.  A hose and a nozzle is connected to the steel drum containing the reformulated product and the water flow draws the product containing the notified polymer and forms a foam spray.  Dermal contact is likely to be the main route of exposure.  Contact with the end-use product may be prolonged depending on the end use circumstances.; There is negligible potential for public exposure to the notified chemical resulting from use as a surface active agent in fire fighting foam.  In the event of a transport accident, the spill is to be contained.  Residual liquids can be absorbed onto sand or other absorbent material and transferred into a closable container for disposal by landfill.  Spills should be prevented from entering storm sewers and drains. Water should not be used as a clean-up medium as large volumes of foam develop and slippery conditions may result.  Emptied containers may contain residual product  and should not be re-used.; There will be no deliberate release unless the product is used for fire-fighting.  The product will be further diluted within the foam.; Most if not all of the fire fighting liquids are contained at the fire site by absorbing onto sand or other absorbent material for disposal by landfill.  Minimal public exposure may result after use of the notified polymer in a fire or accidental spillage. Adequate measures are described by the notifier in the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) to minimise the risk of public exposure during disposal, or in the event of accidental spillage.; The greatest potential for release of the chemical is through its use in fire fighting foams. Such fires would include those in flammable liquid stores or vehicle accidents involving flammable liquid tankers. In the former case, the notifier states that the flammable liquid storage areas where the foam containing the notified chemical will be used are required to have fire water containment such as bunding, sumps and onsite water treatment plants. At least in New South Wales, the fire water will only be released to the sewer with prior consent from the local water authority. If consent is not granted the waste is to be disposed of at a liquid waste facility.; The fate of the chemical in fighting ""real"" fires (such as a tanker accident) is problematic, as it will depend on the size of the fire and the amount of water and foam needed to control the fire. It is likely  that it could enter local waterways via; The chemical will be primarily used as a foaming agent to fight fires that have flammable liquids as a fuel source. The main environmental exposure of the chemical will occur when it is used in fire-fighting training or actual use conditions. In the former case, conditions will be controlled, with bunding and traps preventing the release of both chemical and fuel, to the environment.  Actual use may occur in areas where bunding or traps are used to prevent the release of the flammable liquids to the environment, such as storage areas or refineries or in uncontrolled situations such as tankers carrying flammable liquids.; For a fire in a flammable liquid store, the water/foam is contained and may be released to the sewer if approval is granted from the local water authority. The concentration of the chemical leaving the foam-forming nozzle is less than 0.009% (9 ppm). The release of the water/foam mixture to a metropolitan sewer will lead to a concentration in receiving waters of less than 90 ppb (assuming and a 10× dilution on entering the sewer with a further 10× dilution in the sewage treatment plant and no adsorption or degradation of the chemical). Lower dilution factors are likely in country areas and a maximum concentration of 450 ppb in receiving  waters is possible. Both these concentrations are two to three orders of magnitude below the lowest measured acute effect (Daphnia magna 48 h immobilisation  EC50 = 15.6 mg.L-1) and the estimated toxicity to algae (one sixth the 96 h Pimephales promelas LC50 i.e. 72/6 = 12 mg.L-1). Hence, discharge of the notified chemical into metropolitan or country sewers is not likely to present a hazard to aquatic organisms.; Should the chemical be used  in fire-fighting on  tankers or trucks carrying flammable liquids,  there is potential for the release of the chemical to the environment. The number of accidents in which petroleum fuels, such as petrol, were recorded as the primary ignition source was more than 1000 in 1994, according to figures from the NSW Fire Brigade.; A realistic, worst case situation would,  be an accident involving a fuel tanker, with runoff from the accident entering a lentic (still) water body with significant wild-life. Figures provided by the ACT Fire Brigade indicate that about 4 000 L of water might be used to cool the tanker. Another 4 000 L  together with the foam might be used to control any fire associated with the tanker, eg from spilt petrol and ignition of cabin material. If the fuel load catches alight, then when the fire can be approached, more than 12 000 L of water/foam mix would be needed to control the fire.; applied would be about 1.5 L (0.009% × 16 × 10 L [(4 + 12) × 103 L). The density of 1.12 g.mL-1,  gives 1.6 kg of the notified chemical potentially requiring dispersal. Some of this will be combusted/pyrolysed in the fire leaving the fluorinated residues, although the amount lost is expected to be small. Any notified chemical left would be associated with run-off from the accident site. Run-off into a pond of about 1 ha surface area and an average depth of 15 cm ( volume of about; One important assumption is that all of the chemical applied to the fire would be associated with run-off from the accident site.  The run-off may not all flow into the lake, with some of the run-off adsorbed by road surfaces and soil surrounding the accident site.  Where possible, standard operating procedures of Australian fire brigades should operate to minimise run-off by containment and removal. Also, some losses might be expected through adsorption to sediment and particulate matter because of its surface activity. On entering the surface waters, some of the chemical may partition to sediment, with biodegradation of at least the hydrocarbon portion of the molecule.; Another assumption is that there would be uniform and complete mixing of the chemical in the receiving surface water. This may not occur, and would lead to localised points (eg the entry point of the run-off) where the concentration of the chemical would be elevated.  This could have localised impacts on invertebrate and algal species,  but the effect on fish might be limited as they have the greater ability to avoid contaminated sites. Additionally, the situations in which release to surface waters might occur are likely to be rare. Several factors would have to be met for the chemical to have a major environmental impact. These are: 1) a major accident involving a flammable liquid tanker in which the load would catch alight, 2) the run-off from the fire-fighting escaping to a lentic surface water, and 3) the concentration of the chemical remaining near those affecting aquatic organisms  for a few days. In the later case it should be noted that: (i) the chemical is a surfactant and as such is likely to readily disperse in the pond; and (ii) the  chemical is present in the fire fighting foam at around toxic levels to invertebrate and probably algal species; any dilution, for example from water used to cool tanker or water in the pond would bring it below toxic levels. Hence, the potential environmental hazard from this use is expected to be low.; The notified chemical will be used as a surface acting agent in fire fighting foam to be used by fire-fighters.  Minimal public exposure may result following contact with accidental spills or following use as a fire-fighting foam.  The main route of exposure in these situations would be dermal, and possibly ocular and inhalation.

Due to the environmental distribution of PFHxA resulting from the use pattern of the notified polymer, secondary human exposure to PFHxA via the environment may occur. The notified polymer is replacing a long chain polyfluoroalkyl polymer, the latter of which will result in secondary human exposures to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and longer chain perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs). PFOA and longer chain PFCAs are more hazardous to human health and have higher bioaccumulation potential, compared to PFHxA (Russell et al, 2013). The overall human health risk posed by the notified polymer is less than that of the substance it replaces.; However, degradants of the notified polymer, along with associated impurities and residual monomers of the notified polymer, are potential precursors of the very persistent chemical, PFHxA. The assessed use pattern of the notified polymer does not control the release of breakdown products into the environment during use and after disposal and the long-term environmental risk profile of PFHxA is currently unknown. Consequently, the long-term risk profile for the notified polymer and its degradation products is unknown. This situation may change if further data on the environmental behaviour of the notified polymer and its poly- and perfluoroalkyl degradation products (including PFHxA) were to become available.; The notified polymer is a potential precursor for PFHxA in the environment. PFHxA is an environmentally persistent chemical that has potential to be globally distributed. However, the ecotoxicological profile and bioaccumulation potential of PFHxA is considered to be less problematic when compared with long chain (C8 and above) perfluorocarboxylic acids that PFHxA is expected to replace, noting that current evidence shows that PFHxA was not bioaccumulative in aquatic systems or humans (Russell et al, 2013). Nonetheless, the introduction and use of chemicals that degrade to release PFHxA and other very persistent poly- and perfluoroalkyl compounds should be considered a short-term measure until suitable alternatives, with less persistent chemistry, are identified.; Over time, the notified polymer is expected to become dissociated from the articles. The notified polymer has the potential to disperse in water but it is not expected to hydrolyse under environmental conditions (pH 4 to 9, 25 ºC) based on structural considerations. A test study indicates that the notified polymer is rapidly degradable, achieving 62% degradation in 28 days but failing the 10-day window criteria. Degradation products are not known for certain as no characterisation of the degradation products was undertaken in the biodegradation test. A recent paper found that close analogues of the notified polymer undergo rapid biotransformation via a chain shortening mechanism (see Exempt Information). However, the notified polymer is not expected to completely mineralise and degradation products may include more stable lower molecular weight polymers with per- and polyfluoroalkyl functionality or the very persistent perfluorinated degradation product PFHxA. Therefore, the notified polymer has the potential to release the PFHxA after only a short period of time.; In surface waters, agricultural soils and landfill, the notified polymer is expected to eventually degrade to form water, oxides of carbon and nitrogen and degradation products containing per- and polyfluoroalky functionality. The expected initial per- and polyfluoroalkyl degradation products are assumed to undergo further degradation to form, among other compounds, the very persistent perfluorinated degradation product, PFHxA. It is noted that some volatile degradation intermediates have the potential to undergo long range atmospheric transport and thus may result in translocation of PFHxA in the environment. The notified polymer also contains impurities that may degrade to form perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and other long-chain per- and polyfluorocarboxylic acids.; PFHxA is expected to be recalcitrant in the environment, and potentially undergo long range transport while mainly staying in the water column. In water, it is expected to be very persistent and will not hydrolyse, photolyse or biodegrade.; PEC for PFHxA and long chain perfluoroalkyl substances The notified polymer is assumed to degrade and ultimately form the persistent degradant, PFHxA. However, the yield and rate of conversion of the notified polymer to PFHxA has not been established as characterisation of the degradation products was not undertaken in the biodegradation study. Environmental monitoring data shows that PFHxA, and PFOA which PFHxA-chemistry is replacing, is widely found in the environment, particularly in fresh water close to industrial sources, but also in some biota. Water appears to be the main compartment where PFHxA is found. High measured concentrations of both PFHxA and PFOA in surface waters in Germany have been associated with the legal application of waste materials to agricultural soils (Skutlarek et al., 2006) indicating that these chemicals have the potential to enter the aquatic compartment following initial release into the soil compartment.; By reducing the presence of residual poly- and perfluoroalkyl monomers and impurities in polymers, it is expected that indirect releases from the degradation of polyfluoroalkyl substances will become a significant source of persistent poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances in the environment in the future. PFHxA is already being detected in the environment and as the long chain poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances are phased out in preference for short-chain polyfluoroalkyl chemistry containing a six-carbon perfluorohexyl moiety, the environmental levels of PFHxA are expected to increase.; Perfluoroalkyl substances are expected to be very persistent in the environment (for example, PFOA: t½ (hydrolysis) > 200 years; US EPA 2002) but PFHxA is considered to have low potential for bioaccumulation. There is limited evidence in the published literature of PFHxA toxicity to aquatic organisms on an acute basis, although it is reported to be toxic to marine algae.

Such levels should be as low as practicable: where possible, the total weight of these constituents should not exceed the levels attainable utilising international best practice.; − additional information has become available to the person as to an adverse effect of the poly- or perfluoroalkyl degradation products of the notified polymer (such as PFHxA);; − additional information has become available to the person as to the environmental fate of the polymer or its poly- or perfluoroalkyl degradation products (such as PFHxA) in relation to degradation or partitioning behaviour, including during water treatment processes;; Over time, the notified polymer is expected to ultimately degrade into perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) - CAS name: Hexanoic acid, 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,6-undecafluoro-; CAS No. 307-24-4.; The notified polymer is not expected to undergo significant degradation during use. As such, most potential exposure to workers and the public is expected to be to the notified polymer itself, rather than to its degradation products. Exposure to the residual polyfluoroalkyl starting constituents and/or impurities of the notified polymer (discrete polyfluoroalkyl chemicals containing perfluoroalkyl carbon chain lengths ranging from four to ten) is also possible. Such exposure is limited by the relatively low concentration of polyfluoroalkyl impurities in the notified polymer in imported products (up to 1%) and end use products (up to 0.015%).; Inhalation toxicity Perfluoroalkyl chemicals have been known to cause acute lung injury. Acute lung injury is characterised by respiratory problems ranging from mild to severe effects, including mortality, associated with acute or repeated exposures. Acute lung injury is generally considered to be of most concern when the compound has surface activity (Fischer et al., 2012).; Toxicology of break down products The notified polymer contains perfluoroalkyl side-chains that are potential precursors of PFHxA in the environment (PFHxA; CAS No. 307-24-4), a perfluorinated chemical consisting of 5 perfluorinated carbons (a short chain perfluorinated chemical). The polymer that is proposed for replacement by the notified polymer is expected to break down to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA; CAS No. 335-67-1) (consisting of 7 perfluorinated carbons) and other per- and polyfluorocarboxylic substances with longer perfluoroalkyl carbon chain lengths. The toxicokinetic and toxicological properties of the long chain break down products are generally less favourable compared to the short chain break down products, with properties becoming less favourable with increasing perfluoroalkyl carbon chain length. In addition, it has been established that the bioaccumulation potential of perfluorocarboxylic acids increases with perfluoroalkyl carbon chain length (Conder, 2008; Giesy 2010).; A review of the literature indicates that PFHxA has a less hazardous human health profile, compared to PFOA (refer to Appendix D for details). It is therefore inferred that the human health hazards associated with the expected break down product of the notified polymer (PFHxA) are likely to be similar or less than the human health hazards associated with the expected break down products (PFOA and longer chain perfluorocarboxylic acids) of many per- and polyfluoroalkyl chemicals currently on the market and that are intended for replacement by the notified polymer.; Workers may also be exposed to per- and polyfluoroalkyl impurities of the notified polymer at relatively low concentrations (< 1%), during reformulation. It is expected that the engineering controls and personal protective equipment utilised during these operations (as outlined above) will act to mitigate any risk associated with such exposure.; The public may also be exposed to the notified polymer and low levels of per- and polyfluoroalkyl impurities from direct dermal contact with articles that have either been coated or cleaned with products containing the notified polymer.  This exposure may be on a long term repeated basis. However, dermal transfer from the treated article is expected to be low as the notified polymer will be present at low concentrations and will predominantly remain absorbed to the substrate to which it was applied.  Thus the risk to public health from repeated dermal exposure to the notified polymer from treated articles is not considered to be unreasonable. The risk to public health from long term repeated dermal exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl impurities of the notified polymer from treated articles may be mitigated by the relatively low concentrations at which they are present in end use products.; The public may be exposed indirectly to the ultimate break down product of the notified polymer, PFHxA, via the environment. Such exposure may increase over time due to the persistence of PFHxA in the environment. A quantitative risk assessment for this exposure was not conducted. However, the available data indicates that PFHxA has a more favourable toxicological profile and bioaccumulation potential than the long chain per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances that are the ultimate break down products of the majority of polyfluoroalkyl polymers currently in Australian commerce (such as PFOA). In particular, it is noted that the polymer being replaced contains perfluorinated carbon chain lengths > 6. It is concluded that the risks to human health from indirect exposure to breakdown products of polyfluoroalkyl substances will decrease following introduction of the notified polymer, on the basis that the notified polymer is intended to replace a currently available “long” chain polyfluoroalkyl polymer.; The notified polymer applied to surfaces may also degrade as a result of weathering upon being exposed to environmental conditions after use and after disposal. Degradation may result in the widespread release of degradation products such as perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) to surface waters, landfill and landfill leachates, soils, and other regions where release is not foreseen.; Some of the notified polymer may be released to sewer during reformulation, use and disposal. In general, surfactants have the potential to be removed from influent in sewage treatment plants (STP) via partitioning to phase boundaries. Predictions of the environmental partitioning behaviour of polyfluoroalkyl surfactants such as the notified polymer remain uncertain based on current knowledge because of limited data and their unique properties. In particular, the usual predictive models for partitioning during sewage treatment are inapplicable for chemicals containing perfluorinated functionality as they assume lipophilicity for hydrophobic functionality, whereas the perfluorinated functionality is both hydrophobic and lipophobic. The assumption that surface activity and/or high molecular weight results in efficient removal by sorption to sludge during conventional wastewater treatment has not been verified by supporting data for this class of chemical. Thus, noting its potential to disperse in water, a significant proportion of the notified polymer, and any associated impurities/residual monomers of poly- and perfluoroalkyl compounds, may well remain in the aqueous phase; following wastewater treatment. As such, the notified polymer and the poly- and perfluoroalkyl impurities/residual monomers in wastewater have the potential to be released in STP effluent directly to surface waters or reused in the irrigation of agricultural soils throughout Australia.; Over time, the notified polymer is expected to become dissociated from the articles. The notified polymer has the potential to disperse in water but it is not expected to hydrolyse under environmental conditions (pH 4 to 9, 25 ºC) based on structural considerations. A test study indicates that the notified polymer is rapidly degradable, achieving 62% degradation in 28 days but failing the 10-day window criteria.

A recent paper found that close analogues of the notified polymer undergo rapid biotransformation via a chain shortening mechanism (see Exempt Information). However, the notified polymer is not expected to completely mineralise and degradation products may include more stable lower molecular weight polymers with per- and polyfluoroalkyl functionality or the very persistent perfluorinated degradation product PFHxA. Therefore, the notified polymer has the potential to release the PFHxA after only a short period of time.; In surface waters, agricultural soils and landfill, the notified polymer is expected to eventually degrade to form water, oxides of carbon and nitrogen and degradation products containing per- and polyfluoroalky functionality. The expected initial per- and polyfluoroalkyl degradation products are assumed to undergo further degradation to form, among other compounds, the very persistent perfluorinated degradation product, PFHxA. It is noted that some volatile degradation intermediates have the potential to undergo long range atmospheric transport and thus may result in translocation of PFHxA in the environment. The notified polymer also contains impurities that may degrade to form perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and other long-chain per- and polyfluorocarboxylic acids.; High-temperature incineration is the preferred method of disposal of poly- and perfluoroalkyl compounds due to the environmental persistence characteristics, when it results in mineralisation of the perfluoralkyl functionality to oxides of carbon and hydrofluoric acid. Incomplete combustion of perfluoralkyl functionality may produce an array of partially oxidised fluorocompounds such as perfluoroacetic acid, fluorinated dioxins and furans. Therefore, disposal of the notified polymer and its degradation products by incineration should only take place at facilities that demonstrate complete combustion of the perfluoroalkyl functionality and have adequate measures in place to control release of hydrofluoric acid.; The notified polymer has the potential to bioaccumulate based on its molecular weight and n-octanol/water partition coefficient. Generally, a log Pow of > 4.2 indicates a potential for bioaccumulation as high values indicate a tendency to partition to lipids while a low value indicates a tendency to partition to water. However, this also assumes lipophilicity of the hydrophobic functionality which does not apply to perfluoroalkyl functionality. Certain perfluoroalkyl compounds are known to accumulate in the blood and liver rather than lipids in biological systems (Danish EPA, 2008). As perfluoroalkyl compounds do not follow the usual mechanism for bioaccumulation and are not expected to bioaccumulate in lipids, and because of the notified polymer’s surface-active properties, the n-octanol-water partition coefficient is not considered to be a reliable indicator of bioaccumulation potential for the notified polymer. Further, the notified polymer has the potential to undergo degradation and biotransformation in the environment, reducing its potential to bioaccumulate.; The available laboratory (Higgins et al., 2007; Martin et al., 2003ab; Woodcroft et al., 2010) and field (Falandysz et al., 2006; Falandysz et al., 2007, Furdui et al., 2007) evidence indicates that PFHxA is expected to be less bioaccumulative than PFOA and other long chain perfluoroalkyl compounds, which PFHxA-chemistry is replacing (although PFHxA and PFOA are not considered bioaccumulative).  However, both are bioavailable and can be detected in wildlife as demonstrated by monitoring studies (Kumar et al., 2009; Ye et al., 2008ab; Wang et al., 2008). In aquatic biota, there is little evidence of increased bioconcentration of PFOA compared with PFHxA although PFOA may generally be expected to be found in aquatic organisms more often than PFHxA. In general, the available evidence indicates that the bioaccumulation potential of perfluorinated compounds is correlated with increasing fluorinated carbon chain length (Giesy et al., 2010). Therefore, PFHxA has a lower bioaccumulation potential than PFOA and other long chain perfluorinated compounds, which PFHxA-based chemistry is replacing.; PEC for PFHxA and long chain perfluoroalkyl substances The notified polymer is assumed to degrade and ultimately form the persistent degradant, PFHxA. However, the yield and rate of conversion of the notified polymer to PFHxA has not been established as characterisation of the degradation products was not undertaken in the biodegradation study. Environmental monitoring data shows that PFHxA, and PFOA which PFHxA-chemistry is replacing, is widely found in the environment, particularly in fresh water close to industrial sources, but also in some biota. Water appears to be the main compartment where PFHxA is found. High measured concentrations of both PFHxA and PFOA in surface waters in Germany have been associated with the legal application of waste materials to agricultural soils (Skutlarek et al., 2006) indicating that these chemicals have the potential to enter the aquatic compartment following initial release into the soil compartment.; PFHxA and other poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances have also been found in landfill leachate, with concentrations of PFHxA ranging from 270 – 790 ng/L (Huset et al., 2011).  As landfills are reservoirs of solid waste, and receive waste water treatment plant sludge, which may contain poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances, landfills have the potential to continue to release PFHxA and homologues well into the future.; Historically, release of poly and perfluoroalkyl substances into the environment has been linked to direct releases of low molecular weight poly- and perfluoroalkyl compounds, such as poly- and perfluoroalkyl monomers during polymer manufacture and reformulation processes, rather than breakdown of the polymers themselves. In order to limit the extent of direct release of potential PFHxA precursors to the environment, it is recommended that control measures be implemented to minimise the residual weight percentage of unreacted poly- and perfluoroalkyl monomer constituents and impurities in the notified polymer to the extent practicable. Zhao et al. (2013) report that fluorotelomer alcohol (FTOH) residual raw material content in FTOH-based polymeric products is generally less than 0.1%. Efforts have also been made globally to control releases of perfluoroalkyl acids, such as PFOA and potential precursors, by reducing the presence of residual poly- and perfluoroalkyl monomers and impurities in polymers. It is recommended that the total weight of residual monomers and impurities in the notified polymer containing polyfluoroalkyl functionality should not exceed the levels attainable utilising international best practice and the levels are further reduced using available technological advances, to the extent practicable.; By reducing the presence of residual poly- and perfluoroalkyl monomers and impurities in polymers, it is expected that indirect releases from the degradation of polyfluoroalkyl substances will become a significant source of persistent poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances in the environment in the future. PFHxA is already being detected in the environment and as the long chain poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances are phased out in preference for short-chain polyfluoroalkyl chemistry containing a six-carbon perfluorohexyl moiety, the environmental levels of PFHxA are expected to increase.; Half-lives of polyfluoroalkylated polymers in aerobic soil have so far been found to be indeterminate (Russell; Effects of PFHxA and long chain perfluorocarboxylic acids There are only limited available toxicity data for PFHxA to organisms, and these are limited to aquatic organisms. Based on the available literature, the most sensitive trophic level is algae. Latala et al., (2009) reported the 72-hour median effect concentrations (72 h EC50) for three marine species as follows: 1.0 mg/L for blue green algae (Geitlerinema amphibium); 1.4 mg/L for diatom (Skeletonema marinoi); and, 4.0 mg/L for green algae (Chlorella vulgaris). The data indicates that PFHxA is toxic to algae on an acute basis. The study also investigated the toxicity of PFOA to the three marine species: 0.25 mg/L for blue green algae; 0.37 mg/L for diatom; and, 0.98 mg/L for green algae. The data indicates that PFOA is very toxic to algae on an acute basis and demonstrate decreased toxicity of PFHxA compared with PFOA to three species tested.; Giesy et al. (2010) reported the relationship between increasing carbon chain length and increasing toxicity. Therefore, PFHxA is expected to have a less problematic ecotoxicological profile than PFOA and other long chain perfluorocarboxylic acids it is expected to replace. Long-term effects data that reflect or model the periods over which perfluorocarboxylic acids are present in the environment are not available for PFHxA or long chain perfluorocarboxylic acids. Therefore, the long-term hazard to aquatic organisms has not been adequately established and is unknown.; Perfluoroalkyl substances are expected to be very persistent in the environment (for example, PFOA: t½ (hydrolysis) > 200 years; US EPA 2002) but PFHxA is considered to have low potential for bioaccumulation. There is limited evidence in the published literature of PFHxA toxicity to aquatic organisms on an acute basis, although it is reported to be toxic to marine algae. There is no available data on the long-term aquatic effects of PFHxA.; The main environmental risks associated with polyfluoroalkyl polymers relate to the release of perfluoroalkyl degradation products such as PFHxA. However, it is not possible to quantify the long-term risks of PFHxA to the environment due to knowledge gaps both in predicting environmental concentrations from indirect sources of release and its long-term environmental effects. . To date, the available data on environmental concentrations of PFHxA indicate a low risk of environmental toxicity. However, the long-term environmental risk profile of PFHxA is currently unknown, and further long term research should ideally be undertaken to characterise this risk.; However, degradants of the notified polymer, along with associated impurities and residual monomers of the notified polymer, are potential precursors of the very persistent chemical, PFHxA. The assessed use pattern of the notified polymer does not control the release of breakdown products into the environment during use and after disposal and the long-term environmental risk profile of PFHxA is currently unknown. Consequently, the long-term risk profile of the notified polymer and its degradation products is unknown. This situation may change if further data on the environmental behaviour of the notified polymer and its poly- and perfluoroalkylated degradation products (including PFHxA) were to become available.; The notified polymer is a potential precursor for PFHxA in the environment, PFHxA, is environmentally persistent and has potential to be globally distributed. However, the ecotoxicological profile and bioaccumulation potential of PFHxA is considered to be less problematic when compared with long chain (C8 and above) perfluoroalkyl acids that PFHxA is expected to replace. Nonetheless, it is recommended that the introduction and use of chemicals that degrade to release PFHxA and other very persistent poly- and perfluoroalkyl compounds should be considered a short-term measure until suitable alternatives, with less persistent chemistry, are identified.; In order to limit the extent of direct release of potential PFHxA and long chain perfluorocarboxylic acid precursors to the environment, it is recommended that control measures be implemented to minimise the residual weight percentage of unreacted polyfluoroalkyl monomer constituents and impurities in the notified polymer to the extent practicable. Where possible, the total weight of residual monomers and impurities in the notified polymer containing polyfluoroalkyl functionality should not exceed the levels attainable utilising international best practice. It is recommended that the levels remain within this range and are further reduced using available technological advances, to the extent practicable.; APPENDIX D: TOXICOLOGY OF PERFLUOROHEXANOIC ACID (PFHXA); AGC Chemicals (2010) A 24-month Oral (Gavage) Combined Chronic Toxicity/Carcinogenicity Study of Perfluorohexanoic Acid (PFHxA) in Rats (Study no.

It is recommended that the total weight of residual monomers and impurities in the notified polymer containing polyfluoroalkyl functionality should not exceed the levels attainable utilising international best practice and the levels are further reduced using available technological advances, to the extent practicable.; PFHxA is already wide-spread in surface waters and biota. Continuing release of PFHxA which has no known breakdown mechanism (at least in soil and water) could result in increasing environmental concentrations over time. Hence, there is potential for ecotoxicologically significant concentrations to eventually be reached following its accumulation in the environment. In this eventuality, precursors of PFHxA such as the notified polymer cannot be recalled after release and are a potential source of PFHxA in the environment even long after their use ceases. Thus, use and disposal of the notified polymer increases the environmental risk profile of PFHxA. The notified polymer also contains impurities which are assumed to degrade to form PFHxA. Therefore, considering the dispersive use pattern of the notified polymer, it is recommended to reduce the impurities in the notified polymer that breakdown to form PFHxA, to the extent possible.; The notified polymer is a potential precursor for PFHxA in the environment, PFHxA, is environmentally persistent and has potential to be globally distributed.

Such levels should be as low as practicable. Where possible, the total weight of these constituents should not exceed the levels attainable utilising international best practice.; − additional information has become available as to an adverse effect of the per- or polyfluoroalkyl degradation products of the notified polymer;; DEGRADATION PRODUCTS The notified polymer is a potential precursor for PFHxA (perfluorohexanoic acid – CAS name: Hexanoic acid, 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,6-undecafluoro-, with CAS No. 307-24-4) in the environment.; The notified polymer may undergo slow degradation in the environment. As such, most potential exposure to workers and the public is expected to be to the notified polymer itself, rather than to its degradation products. Exposure to the residual polyfluoroalkyl starting constituents of the notified polymer is also possible.; Hazard implication of breakdown products The notified polymer contains polyfluoroalkyl side-chains that are potential precursors of PFHxA in the environment. PFHxA is a perfluorocarboxylic acid consisting of 5 perfluorinated carbons (a short chain perfluorinated chemical). A review of the literature indicates that PFHxA has a less hazardous human health profile, compared to PFOA (NICNAS, a). The toxicokinetic and toxicological properties of fluorinated substances generally become less favourable with increase of perfluoroalkyl carbon chain length. It has also been reported that the bioaccumulation potential of perfluorocarboxylic acids increases with perfluoroalkyl carbon chain length (Conder, 2008; Giesy 2010). It is therefore inferred that the human health hazards associated with the expected breakdown products of the notified polymer (PFHxA) are likely to be similar or less than those associated with PFOA or longer chain perfluorocarboxylic acids, which are known degradants of many perfluoroalkyl polymers currently on the market.; Workers may also be exposed to per- and polyfluoroalkyl impurities of the notified polymer at low concentrations (≤ 0.1%), during use. It is expected that the PPE utilised during these operations (as outlined above) will mitigate any risk associated with such exposure.; The public may be exposed indirectly to the ultimate break down product of the notified polymer, PFHxA, via the environment. Such exposure may increase over time due to the persistence of PFHxA in the environment. However, the available data indicates that PFHxA has lower bioaccumulation potential than the long chain perfluoroalkyl substances (such as PFOA) that are the ultimate break down products of long chain perfluoroalkyl polymers currently in Australian commerce.; In landfill, the notified polymer is expected to eventually degrade through biotic and abiotic processes to form mainly water and oxides of carbon and silicon, and per- and polyfluoroalkyl degradation products, such as perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA), which is likely to be highly resistant to degradation in the environment. Such chemicals may potentially undergo long range transport while staying largely in the water column. Some of these chemicals have the potential to be classified as PBT chemicals (NICNAS, d), but their fluorinated shorter degradation products are not considered to be PBT chemicals (NICNAS, e).; PFHxA and other poly- and perfluoroalkyl compounds have been found in landfill leachate, with concentrations of PFHxA ranging from 270 – 790 ng/L (Huset et al., 2011). As landfills are reservoirs of solid waste, and receive waste water treatment plant sludge, which may contain poly- and perfluoroalkyl compounds, landfills have the potential to continue to release PFHxA and homologous perfluorinated carboxylic acids well into the future.; Effects of PFHxA and other perfluorocarboxylic acids  The current available data, summarised in the NICNAS IMAP Environment Tier II Assessment for Short-Chain Perfluorocarboxylic Acids and their Direct Precursors, indicate that PFHxA and other short-chain perfluorinated acids (i.e. those with five or fewer perfluorinated carbon atoms) have low toxicity to aquatic life (NICNAS, d and e) compared to PFOA and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) (NICNAS, b and c). However, no long-term intergenerational studies were identified for PFHxA and other short chain PFCAs. Emerging evidence suggests that the most significant aquatic toxicity effects of PFOA and PFOS may manifest in offspring when the parent generation is exposed to PFOA or PFOS (NICNAS, b and c).; On the basis of the assessed use pattern, the notified polymer itself is not considered to directly pose an unreasonable short-term risk to the environment. However, the notified polymer contains fluorinated carbon groups that have the potential to degrade to the exceptionally persistent short-chain perfluorinated carboxylic acid, perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA).; The environmental degradation of the notified polymer is expected to contribute to the cumulative emissions of perfluorohexanoic acid to the environment. Based on the currently available evidence, the concentrations of PFHxA and other short-chain perfluorinated carboxylic acids are not considered to pose a concern for the environment. However, if additional hazard information becomes available to indicate that short-chain perfluorinated carboxylic acids have hazard characteristics of high concern for the environment (such as PBT properties), then the risks posed by industrial uses of precursors to these environmental degradants may need to be re-assessed.; NICNAS (a) IMAP Human Health Tier II Assessment for Short Chain Perfluorocarboxylic Acids and their Direct Precursors.

LTD2031, The notified polymer will be used as a component of industrial and automotive coatings (at < 1% concentration). The notified polymer will be introduced to replace products containing longer polyfluoroalkyl carbon chains.,"However, the notified polymer is anticipated to degrade in the environment to release fluorinated degradants similar to perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) that is known to be persistent. Due to environmental distribution of the persistent chemicals, the use of the notified polymer may lead to secondary human exposure to the fluorinated degradants via the environment. The notified polymer is proposed to replace perfluoroalkyl polymers that may release longer chain perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) in the environment. Longer chain PFCAs are known to be more hazardous to human health with higher bioaccumulation potential compared to shorter chain PFCAs. The overall human health risk posed by the notified polymer is anticipated to be less than that of the perfluoroalkyl polymers it replaces.; Environmental risk assessment On the basis of the assessed use pattern, the notified polymer itself is not considered to directly pose an unreasonable short-term risk to the environment. However, the notified polymer contains fluorinated carbon groups that have the potential to degrade to the exceptionally persistent short-chain perfluorinated carboxylic acid, PFHxA. The assessed use pattern of the notified polymer does not control the release of breakdown products into the environment during use and after disposal and the long-term environmental risk profile of PFHxA is currently unknown. Consequently, the long-term risk profile for the notified polymer and its degradation products is unknown.; The notified polymer is methacrylate-based where one of the ester side chains is polyfluorinated. This polyfluorinated side-chain incorporates a chain segment of six perfluorinated carbon atoms. Under the NICNAS action plan for assessing and managing chemicals that could degrade to perfluorinated carboxylic acids, the notified polymer would be considered to be an indirect precursor to the exceptionally persistent perfluorinated carboxylic acid, perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) and shorter-chain perfluorinated carboxylic acid (NICNAS, b).; PFHxA is a globally distributed pollutant and is expected to be recalcitrant in the environment, potentially undergo long range transport while mainly staying in the water column. In water, it is expected to be very persistent and will not hydrolyse, photolyse or biodegrade under environmental conditions (NICNAS, c).; PEC for PFHxA and other perfluorocarboxylic acids The notified polymer has the potential to degrade and ultimately form the persistent degradant, PFHxA. However, the yield and rate of conversion of the notified polymer to PFHxA and shorter-chain carboxylic acids has not been established and depends on environmental conditions (microbial communities, Eh, pH, soil characteristics and climate conditions); However, the notified polymer has the potential to eventually degrade to form very persistent PFHxA. PFHxA is currently understood to have low potential for bioaccumulation (NICNAS, b). The currently available data also indicate that PFHxA and other short-chain perfluorocarboxylic acids and their direct precursors have low toxicity to aquatic life (NICNAS, b, c).; Conclusions On the basis of the assessed use pattern, the notified polymer itself is not considered to directly pose an unreasonable short-term risk to the environment. However, the notified polymer contains fluorinated carbon groups that have the potential to degrade to the exceptionally persistent short-chain perfluorinated carboxylic acid, PFHxA.; review and comparison with regulatory criteria and persistent lipophilic compounds. Environ Sci Technol;42:995–1003.","However, the notified polymer is anticipated to degrade in the environment to release fluorinated degradants similar to perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) that is known to be persistent. Due to environmental distribution of the persistent chemicals, the use of the notified polymer may lead to secondary human exposure to the fluorinated degradants via the environment. The notified polymer is proposed to replace perfluoroalkyl polymers that may release longer chain perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) in the environment. Longer chain PFCAs are known to be more hazardous to human health with higher bioaccumulation potential compared to shorter chain PFCAs. The overall human health risk posed by the notified polymer is anticipated to be less than that of the perfluoroalkyl polymers it replaces.; The persistence of chemicals similar to PFHxA in the environment is of concern because they have potential to be globally distributed. Based on the currently available environmental hazard information, PFHxA is considered to have lower overall ecotoxicity concerns than homologous long-chain perfluorocarboxylic acids, which contain seven or more perfluorinated carbon atoms, such as perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA).; The environmental degradation of the notified polymer is expected to contribute to the cumulative emissions of perfluorohexanoic acid to the environment. Based on the currently available evidence, the concentrations of PFHxA and other short chain perfluorinated carboxylic acids are not considered to pose a concern for the health of the environment. However, if additional hazard information becomes available to indicate that short-chain perfluorinated carboxylic acids have hazard characteristics of high concern for the environment (such as PBT properties), then the risks posed by industrial uses of precursors to these environmental degradants may need to be re-assessed.; • The notifier should seek ways to minimise the level of residual polyfluoroalkyl monomers and impurities in the notified polymers. Such levels should be as low as practicable. Where possible, the total weight of these constituents should not exceed the levels attainable utilising international best practice.; − additional information has become available as to an adverse effect of the per- or polyfluoroalkyl degradation products of the notified polymer.; DEGRADATION PRODUCTS The notified polymer is a potential precursor for PFHxA (perfluorohexanoic acid – CAS name: hexanoic acid, 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,6-undecafluoro-; CAS No. 307-24-4) in the environment.; USE The notified polymer will be used as a component of industrial and automotive coatings (at < 1% concentration). The notified polymer will be introduced to replace products containing longer polyfluoroalkyl carbon chains.; The notified polymer may undergo slow degradation in the environment. As such, most potential exposure to workers and the public is expected to be to the notified polymer itself, rather than to its degradation products. Exposure to the residual polyfluoroalkyl starting constituents of the notified polymer is also possible.; Hazard implication of breakdown products The notified polymer contains polyfluoroalkyl side-chains that are potential precursors of PFHxA in the environment. PFHxA is a perfluorocarboxylic acid consisting of 5 perfluorinated carbons (a short chain perfluorinated chemical). The notified polymer is proposed to replace products containing polymers with longer perfluoroalkyl carbon chains. It has been known that the toxicokinetic and toxicological properties of fluorinated substances are generally becoming less favourable with increase of perfluoroalkyl carbon chain length. It has also been reported that the bioaccumulation potential of perfluorocarboxylic acids increases with perfluoroalkyl carbon chain length increase (Conder, 2008; Giesy 2010).; A review of the literature indicates that PFHxA has a less hazardous human health profile, compared to PFOA  (NICNAS, a). It is therefore inferred that the human health hazards associated with the expected breakdown products of the notified polymer (PFHxA) are likely to be similar or less than those associated with PFOA or longer chain perfluorocarboxylic acids, which are known degradants of many perfluoroalkyl polymers currently on the market and that are intended to be replaced by the notified polymer.; Workers may also be exposed to per- and polyfluoroalkyl impurities of the notified polymer at low concentrations (< 0.1%), during use. It is expected that the PPE utilised during these operations (as outlined above) will mitigate any risk associated with such exposure.; The public may be exposed indirectly to the ultimate break down product of the notified polymer, PFHxA, via the environment. Such exposure may increase over time due to the persistence of PFHxA in the environment. However, the available data indicates that PFHxA has lower bioaccumulation potential than the long chain perfluoroalkyl substances (such as PFOA) that are the ultimate break down products of long chain perfluoroalkyl polymers currently in Australian commerce. In particular, it is noted that the polymer being replaced contains perfluoroalkyl carbon chain lengths > 6. It is concluded that the risks to human health from indirect exposure to breakdown products of perfluoroalkyl substances will decrease following introduction of the notified polymer, on the basis that the notified polymer is intended to replace products containing polymers with longer perfluoroalkyl carbon chains.; The notified polymer is methacrylate-based where one of the ester side chains is polyfluorinated. This polyfluorinated side-chain incorporates a chain segment of six perfluorinated carbon atoms. Under the NICNAS action plan for assessing and managing chemicals that could degrade to perfluorinated carboxylic acids, the notified polymer would be considered to be an indirect precursor to the exceptionally persistent perfluorinated carboxylic acid, perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) and shorter-chain perfluorinated carboxylic acid (NICNAS, b).; release the 6:2 fluorotelomer alcohol, 6:2 FTOH. This polyfluorinated alcohol is known to undergo environmental biodegradation to form short-chain perfluorocarboxylic acids, including perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) (NICNAS, b).; The notified polymer will eventually degrade in landfill and has the potential to release per- and polyfluoroalkyl degradation products, including short-chain perfluorinated carboxylic acids, such as PFHxA.; PFHxA is expected to be less bioaccumulative than perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and other long-chain perfluoroalkyl acids, supported by the available laboratory evidence (Higgins et al., 2007; Martin et al., 2003a, b; Woodcroft et al., 2010) and field (Falandysz et al., 2006; Falandysz et al., 2007, Furdui et al., 2007) evidence. In general, bioaccumulation potential decreases when the length of the perfluorinated carbon chain is decreased (Ng and Hungerbühler, 2014, Giesy et al., 2010). The short-chain perfluorocarboxylic acids, including PFHxA, have been assessed to have low bioaccumulation potential based on the currently available information (NICNAS, c, d).; PEC for PFHxA and other perfluorocarboxylic acids The notified polymer has the potential to degrade and ultimately form the persistent degradant, PFHxA. However, the yield and rate of conversion of the notified polymer to PFHxA and shorter-chain carboxylic acids has not been established and depends on environmental conditions (microbial communities, Eh, pH, soil characteristics and climate conditions); Analyses of drinking water samples from Europe, Canada, the USA, Japan, India and China have also detected PFHxA and other short chain perfluoroalkyl compounds. PFHxA was recently detected in all samples taken from the Parramatta River (main tributary of Sydney Harbour), with a mean concentration of 2.9 ng/L. Sampling of the Brisbane River catchment following a major flooding event in 2011 also found PFHxA present in water at Somerset Dam, Wivenhoe Dam, Jindalee, Oxley Creek, West End, Bulimba and Moreton Bay. The chemical was detected in all samples obtained at these sites in concentrations ranging between 0.06 and 6.2 ng/L (NICNAS, c).; PFHxA and other poly- and perfluoroalkyl compounds have also been found in landfill leachate, with concentrations of PFHxA ranging from 270 – 790 ng/L (Huset et al., 2011). As landfills are reservoirs of solid; waste, and receive waste water treatment plant sludge, which may contain poly- and perfluoroalkyl compounds, landfills have the potential to continue to release PFHxA and homologous perfluorinated carboxylic acids well into the future.; Effects of PFHxA and other perfluorocarboxylic acids  The currently available data, summarised in the NICNAS IMAP Environment Tier II Assessment for Short-Chain Perfluorocarboxylic Acids and their Direct Precursors, indicate that PFHxA and other short-chain perfluorinated acids (i.e. those with five or fewer perfluorinated carbon atoms) have low toxicity to aquatic life (NICNAS, c,f) compared to PFOA and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) (NICNAS, d, f). However, no long-term intergenerational studies were identified for PFHxA and other short chain short-chain PFCAs. Emerging evidence suggest that the most significant aquatic toxicity effects of PFOA and PFOS may manifest in offspring when the parent generation is exposed to PFOA or PFOS (NICNAS, d, f).; However, the notified polymer has the potential to eventually degrade to form very persistent PFHxA. PFHxA is currently understood to have low potential for bioaccumulation (NICNAS, b). The currently available data also indicate that PFHxA and other short-chain perfluorocarboxylic acids and their direct precursors have low toxicity to aquatic life (NICNAS, b, c).; The main environmental risks associated with polyfluoroalkyl polymers relate to the release of perfluorinated degradation products such as PFHxA. It is not possible to quantify the release of PFHxA to the environment from the use of the notified polymer at present. However, as use of chemicals/polymers that degrade to form PFHxA increases, levels of PFHxA may build up in the environment. Hence, there is potential for environmentally significant concentrations to eventually be reached following its accumulation in the environment. In this eventuality, precursors of PFHxA such as the notified polymer cannot be recalled after release and are potential sources of PFHxA releases into the environment even long after their use ceases. Thus, use and disposal of the notified polymer will likely lead to increases in the levels of PFHxA in the environment.; The environmental degradation of the notified polymer is expected to contribute to the cumulative emissions of perfluorohexanoic acid to the environment. Based on the currently available evidence, the concentrations of PFHxA and other short-chain perfluorinated carboxylic acids are not considered to pose a concern for the health of the environment. However, if additional hazard information becomes available to indicate that short-chain perfluorinated carboxylic acids have hazard characteristics of high concern for the environment (such as PBT properties), then the risks posed by industrial uses of precursors to these environmental degradants may need to be re-assessed.; During metal recycling incomplete combustion of perfluoroalkyl functionality may produce an array of partially oxidised fluoro-compounds and hydrofluoric acid. The emissions of hydrofluoric acid should be controlled to; Furdui V, Stock N, Ellis D, Butt C, Whittle D, Crozier P, Reiner E, Muir D and Mabury S (2007) Spatial Distribution of Perfluoroalkyl Contaminants in Lake Trout from the Great Lakes.

PFOA and longer chain PFCAs are more hazardous to human health and have higher bioaccumulation potential, compared to PFHxA (Russell et al, 2013).

The assessed use pattern of the notified polymer does not control the release of breakdown products into the environment during use and after disposal and the long-term environmental risk profile of PFHxA is currently unknown. Consequently, the long-term risk profile for the notified polymer and its degradation products is unknown. This situation may change if further data on the environmental behaviour of the notified polymer and its poly- and perfluoroalkyl degradation products (including PFHxA) were to become available.; The notified polymer is a potential precursor for PFHxA in the environment. PFHxA is an environmentally persistent chemical that has potential to be globally distributed. However, the ecotoxicological profile and bioaccumulation potential of PFHxA is considered to be less problematic when compared with long chain (C8 and above) perfluorocarboxylic acids that PFHxA is expected to replace, noting that current evidence shows that PFHxA was not bioaccumulative in aquatic systems or humans (Russell et al, 2013).

However, the notified polymer is not expected to completely mineralise and degradation products may include more stable lower molecular weight polymers with per- and polyfluoroalkyl functionality or the very persistent perfluorinated degradation product PFHxA. Therefore, the notified polymer has the potential to release the PFHxA after only a short period of time.; functionality. The expected initial per- and polyfluoroalkyl degradation products are assumed to undergo further degradation to form, among other compounds, the very persistent perfluorinated degradation product, PFHxA. It is noted that some volatile degradation intermediates have the potential to undergo long range atmospheric transport and thus may result in translocation of PFHxA in the environment. The notified polymer also contains impurities that may degrade to form perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and other long-chain per- and polyfluorocarboxylic acids.; PFHxA is expected to be recalcitrant in the environment, and potentially undergo long range transport while mainly staying in the water column. In water, it is expected to be very persistent and will not hydrolyse, photolyse or biodegrade.; PEC for PFHxA and long chain perfluoroalkyl substances The notified polymer is assumed to degrade and ultimately form the persistent degradant, PFHxA. However, the yield and rate of conversion of the notified polymer to PFHxA has not been established as characterisation; By reducing the presence of residual poly- and perfluoroalkyl monomers and impurities in polymers, it is expected that indirect releases from the degradation of polyfluoroalkyl substances will become a significant source of persistent poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances in the environment in the future.

As such, most potential exposure to workers and the public is expected to be to the notified polymer itself, rather than to its degradation products. Exposure to the residual polyfluoroalkyl starting constituents and/or impurities of the notified polymer (discrete polyfluoroalkyl chemicals containing perfluoroalkyl carbon chain lengths ranging from four to ten) is also possible. Such exposure is limited by the relatively low concentration of polyfluoroalkyl impurities in the notified polymer in imported products (up to 1%) and end use products (up to 0.015%).; Inhalation toxicity Perfluoroalkyl chemicals have been known to cause acute lung injury. Acute lung injury is characterised by respiratory problems ranging from mild to severe effects, including mortality, associated with acute or repeated exposures. Acute lung injury is generally considered to be of most concern when the compound has surface activity (Fischer et al., 2012).; Toxicology of break down products The notified polymer contains perfluoroalkyl side-chains that are potential precursors of PFHxA in the environment (PFHxA; CAS No. 307-24-4), a perfluorinated chemical consisting of 5 perfluorinated carbons (a short chain perfluorinated chemical). The polymer that is proposed for replacement by the notified polymer is expected to break down to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA; CAS No. 335-67-1) (consisting of 7 perfluorinated carbons) and other per- and polyfluorocarboxylic substances with longer perfluoroalkyl carbon chain lengths. The toxicokinetic and toxicological properties of the long chain break down products are generally less favourable compared to the short chain break down products, with properties becoming less favourable with increasing perfluoroalkyl carbon chain length. In addition, it has been established that the bioaccumulation potential of perfluorocarboxylic acids increases with perfluoroalkyl carbon chain length (Conder, 2008; Giesy 2010).; A review of the literature indicates that PFHxA has a less hazardous human health profile, compared to PFOA (refer to Appendix D for details). It is therefore inferred that the human health hazards associated with the expected break down product of the notified polymer (PFHxA) are likely to be similar or less than the human health hazards associated with the expected break down products (PFOA and longer chain perfluorocarboxylic acids) of many per- and polyfluoroalkyl chemicals currently on the market and that are intended for replacement by the notified polymer.; Workers may also be exposed to per- and polyfluoroalkyl impurities of the notified polymer at relatively low concentrations (< 1%), during reformulation. It is expected that the engineering controls and personal protective equipment utilised during these operations (as outlined above) will act to mitigate any risk associated with such exposure.; The public may also be exposed to the notified polymer and low levels of per- and polyfluoroalkyl impurities from direct dermal contact with articles that have either been coated or cleaned with products containing the notified polymer.  This exposure may be on a long term repeated basis. However, dermal transfer from the treated article is expected to be low as the notified polymer will be present at low concentrations and will predominantly remain absorbed to the substrate to which it was applied.  Thus the risk to public health from repeated dermal exposure to the notified polymer from treated articles is not considered to be unreasonable. The risk to public health from long term repeated dermal exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl impurities of the notified polymer from treated articles may be mitigated by the relatively low concentrations at which they are present in end use products.; The public may be exposed indirectly to the ultimate break down product of the notified polymer, PFHxA, via the environment. Such exposure may increase over time due to the persistence of PFHxA in the environment. A quantitative risk assessment for this exposure was not conducted. However, the available data indicates that PFHxA has a more favourable toxicological profile and bioaccumulation potential than the long chain per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances that are the ultimate break down products of the majority of polyfluoroalkyl polymers currently in Australian commerce (such as PFOA). In particular, it is noted that the polymer being replaced contains perfluorinated carbon chain lengths > 6. It is concluded that the risks to human health from indirect exposure to breakdown products of polyfluoroalkyl substances will decrease following introduction of the notified polymer, on the basis that the notified polymer is intended to replace a currently available “long” chain polyfluoroalkyl polymer.; The notified polymer applied to surfaces may also degrade as a result of weathering upon being exposed to environmental conditions after use and after disposal. Degradation may result in the widespread release of degradation products such as perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) to surface waters, landfill and landfill leachates, soils, and other regions where release is not foreseen.; Some of the notified polymer may be released to sewer during reformulation, use and disposal. In general, surfactants have the potential to be removed from influent in sewage treatment plants (STP) via partitioning to phase boundaries. Predictions of the environmental partitioning behaviour of polyfluoroalkyl surfactants such as the notified polymer remain uncertain based on current knowledge because of limited data and their unique properties. In particular, the usual predictive models for partitioning during sewage treatment are inapplicable for chemicals containing perfluorinated functionality as they assume lipophilicity for hydrophobic functionality, whereas the perfluorinated functionality is both hydrophobic and lipophobic. The assumption that surface activity and/or high molecular weight results in efficient removal by sorption to sludge during conventional wastewater treatment has not been verified by supporting data for this class of chemical. Thus, noting its potential to disperse in water, a significant proportion of the notified polymer, and any associated impurities/residual monomers of poly- and perfluoroalkyl compounds, may well remain in the aqueous phase following wastewater treatment. As such, the notified polymer and the poly- and perfluoroalkyl impurities/residual monomers in wastewater have the potential to be released in STP effluent directly to surface waters or reused in the irrigation of agricultural soils throughout Australia.; Over time, the notified polymer is expected to become dissociated from the articles. The notified polymer has the potential to disperse in water but it is not expected to hydrolyse under environmental conditions (pH 4 to 9, 25 ºC) based on structural considerations.

Therefore, the notified polymer has the potential to release the PFHxA after only a short period of time.; In surface waters, agricultural soils and landfill, the notified polymer is expected to eventually degrade to form water, oxides of carbon and nitrogen and degradation products containing per- and polyfluoroalky; functionality. The expected initial per- and polyfluoroalkyl degradation products are assumed to undergo further degradation to form, among other compounds, the very persistent perfluorinated degradation product, PFHxA. It is noted that some volatile degradation intermediates have the potential to undergo long range atmospheric transport and thus may result in translocation of PFHxA in the environment. The notified polymer also contains impurities that may degrade to form perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and other long-chain per- and polyfluorocarboxylic acids.; High-temperature incineration is the preferred method of disposal of poly- and perfluoroalkyl compounds due to the environmental persistence characteristics, when it results in mineralisation of the perfluoralkyl functionality to oxides of carbon and hydrofluoric acid. Incomplete combustion of perfluoralkyl functionality may produce an array of partially oxidised fluorocompounds such as perfluoroacetic acid, fluorinated dioxins and furans. Therefore, disposal of the notified polymer and its degradation products by incineration should only take place at facilities that demonstrate complete combustion of the perfluoroalkyl functionality and have adequate measures in place to control release of hydrofluoric acid.; The notified polymer has the potential to bioaccumulate based on its molecular weight and n-octanol/water partition coefficient. Generally, a log Pow of > 4.2 indicates a potential for bioaccumulation as high values indicate a tendency to partition to lipids while a low value indicates a tendency to partition to water. However, this also assumes lipophilicity of the hydrophobic functionality which does not apply to perfluoroalkyl functionality. Certain perfluoroalkyl compounds are known to accumulate in the blood and liver rather than lipids in biological systems (Danish EPA, 2008). As perfluoroalkyl compounds do not follow the usual mechanism for bioaccumulation and are not expected to bioaccumulate in lipids, and because of the notified polymer’s surface-active properties, the n-octanol-water partition coefficient is not considered to be a reliable indicator of bioaccumulation potential for the notified polymer. Further, the notified polymer has the potential to undergo degradation and biotransformation in the environment, reducing its potential to bioaccumulate.; The available laboratory (Higgins et al., 2007; Martin et al., 2003ab; Woodcroft et al., 2010) and field (Falandysz et al., 2006; Falandysz et al., 2007, Furdui et al., 2007) evidence indicates that PFHxA is expected to be less bioaccumulative than PFOA and other long chain perfluoroalkyl compounds, which PFHxA-chemistry is replacing (although PFHxA and PFOA are not considered bioaccumulative).  However, both are bioavailable and can be detected in wildlife as demonstrated by monitoring studies (Kumar et al., 2009; Ye et al., 2008ab; Wang et al., 2008). In aquatic biota, there is little evidence of increased bioconcentration of PFOA compared with PFHxA although PFOA may generally be expected to be found in aquatic organisms more often than PFHxA. In general, the available evidence indicates that the bioaccumulation potential of perfluorinated compounds is correlated with increasing fluorinated carbon chain length (Giesy et al., 2010). Therefore, PFHxA has a lower bioaccumulation potential than PFOA and other long chain perfluorinated compounds, which PFHxA-based chemistry is replacing.; PEC for PFHxA and long chain perfluoroalkyl substances The notified polymer is assumed to degrade and ultimately form the persistent degradant, PFHxA. However, the yield and rate of conversion of the notified polymer to PFHxA has not been established as characterisation; PFHxA and other poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances have also been found in landfill leachate, with concentrations of PFHxA ranging from 270 – 790 ng/L (Huset et al., 2011).  As landfills are reservoirs of solid waste, and receive waste water treatment plant sludge, which may contain poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances, landfills have the potential to continue to release PFHxA and homologues well into the future.; Historically, release of poly and perfluoroalkyl substances into the environment has been linked to direct releases of low molecular weight poly- and perfluoroalkyl compounds, such as poly- and perfluoroalkyl monomers during polymer manufacture and reformulation processes, rather than breakdown of the polymers themselves. In order to limit the extent of direct release of potential PFHxA precursors to the environment, it is recommended that control measures be implemented to minimise the residual weight percentage of unreacted poly- and perfluoroalkyl monomer constituents and impurities in the notified polymer to the extent practicable. Zhao et al. (2013) report that fluorotelomer alcohol (FTOH) residual raw material content in FTOH-based polymeric products is generally less than 0.1%. Efforts have also been made globally to control releases of perfluoroalkyl acids, such as PFOA and potential precursors, by reducing the presence of residual poly- and perfluoroalkyl monomers and impurities in polymers. It is recommended that the total weight of residual monomers and impurities in the notified polymer containing polyfluoroalkyl functionality should not exceed the levels attainable utilising international best practice and the levels are further reduced using available technological advances, to the extent practicable.; By reducing the presence of residual poly- and perfluoroalkyl monomers and impurities in polymers, it is expected that indirect releases from the degradation of polyfluoroalkyl substances will become a significant source of persistent poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances in the environment in the future. PFHxA is already being detected in the environment and as the long chain poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances are phased out in preference for short-chain polyfluoroalkyl chemistry containing a six-carbon perfluorohexyl moiety, the environmental levels of PFHxA are expected to increase.; Half-lives of polyfluoroalkylated polymers in aerobic soil have so far been found to be indeterminate (Russell et al., 2008; Russell et al., 2010; Washington et al, 2009). The half-lives of PFHxA in various environmental media are also unknown and its partitioning behaviour is uncertain. Further, degradation products of the notified polymer are unknown as characterisation was not undertaken in the biodegradation study. Therefore, a PEC for indirect releases of PFHxA arising from proposed use and disposal of the notified polymer in Australia cannot be determined.; Effects of PFHxA and long chain perfluorocarboxylic acids  There are only limited available toxicity data for PFHxA to organisms, and these are limited to aquatic organisms. Based on the available literature, the most sensitive trophic level is algae. Latala et al., (2009) reported the 72-hour median effect concentrations (72 h EC50) for three marine species as follows: 1.0 mg/L for blue green algae (Geitlerinema amphibium); 1.4 mg/L for diatom (Skeletonema marinoi); and, 4.0 mg/L for green algae (Chlorella vulgaris). The data indicates that PFHxA is toxic to algae on an acute basis. The study also investigated the toxicity of PFOA to the three marine species: 0.25 mg/L for blue green algae; 0.37 mg/L for diatom; and, 0.98 mg/L for green algae. The data indicates that PFOA is very toxic to algae on an acute basis and demonstrate decreased toxicity of PFHxA compared with PFOA to three species tested.; Giesy et al. (2010) reported the relationship between increasing carbon chain length and increasing toxicity. Therefore, PFHxA is expected to have a less problematic ecotoxicological profile than PFOA and other long chain perfluorocarboxylic acids it is expected to replace. Long-term effects data that reflect or model the periods over which perfluorocarboxylic acids are present in the environment are not available for PFHxA or long chain perfluorocarboxylic acids. Therefore, the long-term hazard to aquatic organisms has not been adequately established and is unknown.; Perfluoroalkyl substances are expected to be very persistent in the environment (for example, PFOA:; The main environmental risks associated with polyfluoroalkyl polymers relate to the release of perfluoroalkyl degradation products such as PFHxA. However, it is not possible to quantify the long-term risks of PFHxA to the environment due to knowledge gaps both in predicting environmental concentrations from indirect sources of release and its long-term environmental effects. . To date, the available data on environmental concentrations of PFHxA indicate a low risk of environmental toxicity. However, the long-term environmental risk profile of PFHxA is currently unknown, and further long term research should ideally be undertaken to characterise this risk.; However, degradants of the notified polymer, along with associated impurities and residual monomers of the notified polymer, are potential precursors of the very persistent chemical, PFHxA. The assessed use pattern of the notified polymer does not control the release of breakdown products into the environment during use and after disposal and the long-term environmental risk profile of PFHxA is currently unknown. Consequently, the long-term risk profile of the notified polymer and its degradation products is unknown. This situation may change if further data on the environmental behaviour of the notified polymer and its poly- and perfluoroalkylated degradation products (including PFHxA) were to become available.; The notified polymer is a potential precursor for PFHxA in the environment, PFHxA, is environmentally persistent and has potential to be globally distributed. However, the ecotoxicological profile and bioaccumulation potential of PFHxA is considered to be less problematic when compared with long chain (C8 and above) perfluoroalkyl acids that PFHxA is expected to replace. Nonetheless, it is recommended that the introduction and use of chemicals that degrade to release PFHxA and other very persistent poly- and perfluoroalkyl compounds should be considered a short-term measure until suitable alternatives, with less persistent chemistry, are identified.; In order to limit the extent of direct release of potential PFHxA and long chain perfluorocarboxylic acid precursors to the environment, it is recommended that control measures be implemented to minimise the residual weight percentage of unreacted polyfluoroalkyl monomer constituents and impurities in the notified polymer to the extent practicable. Where possible, the total weight of residual monomers and impurities in the notified polymer containing polyfluoroalkyl functionality should not exceed the levels attainable utilising international best practice. It is recommended that the levels remain within this range and are further reduced using available technological advances, to the extent practicable.; APPENDIX D: TOXICOLOGY OF PERFLUOROHEXANOIC ACID (PFHXA); AGC Chemicals (2010) A 24-month Oral (Gavage) Combined Chronic Toxicity/Carcinogenicity Study of Perfluorohexanoic Acid (PFHxA) in Rats (Study no.

Continuing release of PFHxA which has no known breakdown mechanism (at least in soil and water) could result in increasing environmental concentrations over time. Hence, there is potential for ecotoxicologically significant concentrations to eventually be reached following its accumulation in the environment. In this eventuality, precursors of PFHxA such as the notified polymer cannot be recalled after release and are a potential source of PFHxA in the environment even long after their use ceases. Thus, use and disposal of the notified polymer increases the environmental risk profile of PFHxA. The notified polymer also contains impurities which are assumed to degrade to form PFHxA.

Due to the environmental distribution of PFHxA resulting from the use pattern of the notified polymer, secondary human exposure to PFHxA via the environment may occur. The notified polymer is replacing a long chain polyfluoroalkyl polymer, the latter of which will result in secondary human exposures to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and longer chain perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs). PFOA and longer chain PFCAs are more hazardous to human health and have higher bioaccumulation potential, compared to PFHxA (Russell et al, 2013).

Nonetheless, the introduction and use of chemicals that degrade to release PFHxA and other very persistent poly- and perfluoroalkyl compounds should be considered a short-term measure until suitable alternatives, with less persistent chemistry, are identified.; Over time, the notified polymer is expected to become dissociated from the articles. The notified polymer has the potential to disperse in water but it is not expected to hydrolyse under environmental conditions (pH 4 to 9, 25 ºC) based on structural considerations. A test study indicates that the notified polymer is rapidly degradable, achieving 62% degradation in 28 days but failing the 10-day window criteria. Degradation products are not known for certain as no characterisation of the degradation products was undertaken in the biodegradation test. A recent paper found that close analogues of the notified polymer undergo rapid biotransformation via a chain shortening mechanism (see Exempt Information). However, the notified polymer is not expected to completely mineralise and degradation products may include more stable lower molecular weight polymers with per- and polyfluoroalkyl functionality or the very persistent perfluorinated degradation product PFHxA. Therefore, the notified polymer has the potential to release the PFHxA after only a short period of time.; In surface waters, agricultural soils and landfill, the notified polymer is expected to eventually degrade to form water, oxides of carbon and nitrogen and degradation products containing per- and polyfluoroalky functionality. The expected initial per- and polyfluoroalkyl degradation products are assumed to undergo further degradation to form, among other compounds, the very persistent perfluorinated degradation product, PFHxA. It is noted that some volatile degradation intermediates have the potential to undergo long range atmospheric transport and thus may result in translocation of PFHxA in the environment. The notified polymer also contains impurities that may degrade to form perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and other long-chain per- and polyfluorocarboxylic acids.; PFHxA is expected to be recalcitrant in the environment, and potentially undergo long range transport while mainly staying in the water column. In water, it is expected to be very persistent and will not hydrolyse, photolyse or biodegrade.; PEC for PFHxA and long chain perfluoroalkyl substances The notified polymer is assumed to degrade and ultimately form the persistent degradant, PFHxA. However, the yield and rate of conversion of the notified polymer to PFHxA has not been established as characterisation of the degradation products was not undertaken in the biodegradation study. Environmental monitoring data shows that PFHxA, and PFOA which PFHxA-chemistry is replacing, is widely found in the environment, particularly in fresh water close to industrial sources, but also in some biota. Water appears to be the main compartment where PFHxA is found. High measured concentrations of both PFHxA and PFOA in surface waters in Germany have been associated with the legal application of waste materials to agricultural soils (Skutlarek et al., 2006) indicating that these chemicals have the potential to enter the aquatic compartment following initial release into the soil compartment.; By reducing the presence of residual poly- and perfluoroalkyl monomers and impurities in polymers, it is expected that indirect releases from the degradation of polyfluoroalkyl substances will become a significant source of persistent poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances in the environment in the future.

Nonetheless, the introduction and use of chemicals that degrade to release PFHxA and other very persistent poly- and perfluoroalkyl compounds should be considered a short-term measure until suitable alternatives, with less persistent chemistry, are identified.; • The notifier should seek ways to minimise the level of residual polyfluoroalkyl monomers and impurities in the notified polymer. Such levels should be as low as practicable: where possible, the total weight of these constituents should not exceed the levels attainable utilising international best practice.; − additional information has become available to the person as to an adverse effect of the poly- or perfluoroalkyl degradation products of the notified polymer (such as PFHxA);; − additional information has become available to the person as to the environmental fate of the polymer or its poly- or perfluoroalkyl degradation products (such as PFHxA) in relation to degradation or partitioning behaviour, including during water treatment processes;; Over time, the notified polymer is expected to ultimately degrade into perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) - CAS name: Hexanoic acid, 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,6-undecafluoro-; CAS No. 307-24-4.; The notified polymer is not expected to undergo significant degradation during use. As such, most potential exposure to workers and the public is expected to be to the notified polymer itself, rather than to its degradation products. Exposure to the residual polyfluoroalkyl starting constituents and/or impurities of the notified polymer (discrete polyfluoroalkyl chemicals containing perfluoroalkyl carbon chain lengths ranging from four to ten) is also possible. Such exposure is limited by the relatively low concentration of polyfluoroalkyl impurities in the notified polymer in imported products (up to 1%) and end use products (up to 0.015%).; Inhalation toxicity Perfluoroalkyl chemicals have been known to cause acute lung injury. Acute lung injury is characterised by respiratory problems ranging from mild to severe effects, including mortality, associated with acute or repeated exposures. Acute lung injury is generally considered to be of most concern when the compound has surface activity (Fischer et al., 2012).; Toxicology of break down products The notified polymer contains perfluoroalkyl side-chains that are potential precursors of PFHxA in the environment (PFHxA; CAS No. 307-24-4), a perfluorinated chemical consisting of 5 perfluorinated carbons (a short chain perfluorinated chemical). The polymer that is proposed for replacement by the notified polymer is expected to break down to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA; CAS No. 335-67-1) (consisting of 7 perfluorinated carbons) and other per- and polyfluorocarboxylic substances with longer perfluoroalkyl carbon chain lengths. The toxicokinetic and toxicological properties of the long chain break down products are generally less favourable compared to the short chain break down products, with properties becoming less favourable with increasing perfluoroalkyl carbon chain length. In addition, it has been established that the bioaccumulation potential of perfluorocarboxylic acids increases with perfluoroalkyl carbon chain length (Conder, 2008; Giesy; A review of the literature indicates that PFHxA has a less hazardous human health profile, compared to PFOA (refer to Appendix D for details). It is therefore inferred that the human health hazards associated with the expected break down product of the notified polymer (PFHxA) are likely to be similar or less than the human health hazards associated with the expected break down products (PFOA and longer chain perfluorocarboxylic acids) of many per- and polyfluoroalkyl chemicals currently on the market and that are intended for replacement by the notified polymer.; Workers may also be exposed to per- and polyfluoroalkyl impurities of the notified polymer at relatively low concentrations (< 1%), during reformulation. It is expected that the engineering controls and personal protective equipment utilised during these operations (as outlined above) will act to mitigate any risk associated with such exposure.; The public may also be exposed to the notified polymer and low levels of per- and polyfluoroalkyl impurities from direct dermal contact with articles that have either been coated or cleaned with products containing the notified polymer.  This exposure may be on a long term repeated basis. However, dermal transfer from the treated article is expected to be low as the notified polymer will be present at low concentrations and will predominantly remain absorbed to the substrate to which it was applied.  Thus the risk to public health from repeated dermal exposure to the notified polymer from treated articles is not considered to be unreasonable. The risk to public health from long term repeated dermal exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl impurities of the notified polymer from treated articles may be mitigated by the relatively low concentrations at which they are present in end use products.; The public may be exposed indirectly to the ultimate break down product of the notified polymer, PFHxA, via the environment. Such exposure may increase over time due to the persistence of PFHxA in the environment. A quantitative risk assessment for this exposure was not conducted. However, the available data indicates that PFHxA has a more favourable toxicological profile and bioaccumulation potential than the long chain per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances that are the ultimate break down products of the majority of polyfluoroalkyl polymers currently in Australian commerce (such as PFOA). In particular, it is noted that the polymer being replaced contains perfluorinated carbon chain lengths > 6. It is concluded that the risks to human health from indirect exposure to breakdown products of polyfluoroalkyl substances will decrease following introduction of the notified polymer, on the basis that the notified polymer is intended to replace a currently available “long” chain polyfluoroalkyl polymer.; The notified polymer applied to surfaces may also degrade as a result of weathering upon being exposed to environmental conditions after use and after disposal. Degradation may result in the widespread release of degradation products such as perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) to surface waters, landfill and landfill leachates, soils, and other regions where release is not foreseen.; Some of the notified polymer may be released to sewer during reformulation, use and disposal. In general, surfactants have the potential to be removed from influent in sewage treatment plants (STP) via partitioning to phase boundaries. Predictions of the environmental partitioning behaviour of polyfluoroalkyl surfactants such as the notified polymer remain uncertain based on current knowledge because of limited data and their unique properties. In particular, the usual predictive models for partitioning during sewage treatment are inapplicable for chemicals containing perfluorinated functionality as they assume lipophilicity for hydrophobic functionality, whereas the perfluorinated functionality is both hydrophobic and lipophobic. The assumption that surface activity and/or high molecular weight results in efficient removal by sorption to sludge during conventional wastewater treatment has not been verified by supporting data for this class of chemical. Thus, noting its potential to disperse in water, a significant proportion of the notified polymer, and any associated impurities/residual monomers of poly- and perfluoroalkyl compounds, may well remain in the aqueous phase following wastewater treatment. As such, the notified polymer and the poly- and perfluoroalkyl impurities/residual monomers in wastewater have the potential to be released in STP effluent directly to surface waters or reused in the irrigation of agricultural soils throughout Australia.; Over time, the notified polymer is expected to become dissociated from the articles. The notified polymer has the potential to disperse in water but it is not expected to hydrolyse under environmental conditions (pH 4 to 9, 25 ºC) based on structural considerations. A test study indicates that the notified polymer is rapidly degradable, achieving 62% degradation in 28 days but failing the 10-day window criteria. Degradation products are not known for certain as no characterisation of the degradation products was undertaken in the biodegradation test. A recent paper found that close analogues of the notified polymer undergo rapid biotransformation via a chain shortening mechanism (see Exempt Information). However, the notified polymer is not expected to completely mineralise and degradation products may include more stable lower molecular weight polymers with per- and polyfluoroalkyl functionality or the very persistent perfluorinated degradation product PFHxA. Therefore, the notified polymer has the potential to release the PFHxA after only a short period of time.; In surface waters, agricultural soils and landfill, the notified polymer is expected to eventually degrade to form water, oxides of carbon and nitrogen and degradation products containing per- and polyfluoroalky functionality. The expected initial per- and polyfluoroalkyl degradation products are assumed to undergo further degradation to form, among other compounds, the very persistent perfluorinated degradation product, PFHxA. It is noted that some volatile degradation intermediates have the potential to undergo long range atmospheric transport and thus may result in translocation of PFHxA in the environment. The notified polymer also contains impurities that may degrade to form perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and other long-chain per- and polyfluorocarboxylic acids.; High-temperature incineration is the preferred method of disposal of poly- and perfluoroalkyl compounds due to the environmental persistence characteristics, when it results in mineralisation of the perfluoralkyl functionality to oxides of carbon and hydrofluoric acid. Incomplete combustion of perfluoralkyl functionality may produce an array of partially oxidised fluorocompounds such as perfluoroacetic acid, fluorinated dioxins and furans. Therefore, disposal of the notified polymer and its degradation products by incineration should only take place at facilities that demonstrate complete combustion of the perfluoroalkyl functionality and have adequate measures in place to control release of hydrofluoric acid.; The notified polymer has the potential to bioaccumulate based on its molecular weight and n-octanol/water partition coefficient. Generally, a log Pow of > 4.2 indicates a potential for bioaccumulation as high values indicate a tendency to partition to lipids while a low value indicates a tendency to partition to water. However, this also assumes lipophilicity of the hydrophobic functionality which does not apply to perfluoroalkyl functionality. Certain perfluoroalkyl compounds are known to accumulate in the blood and liver rather than lipids in biological systems (Danish EPA, 2008). As perfluoroalkyl compounds do not follow the usual mechanism for bioaccumulation and are not expected to bioaccumulate in lipids, and because of the notified polymer’s surface-active properties, the n-octanol-water partition coefficient is not considered to be a reliable indicator of bioaccumulation potential for the notified polymer. Further, the notified polymer has the potential to undergo degradation and biotransformation in the environment, reducing its potential to bioaccumulate.; The available laboratory (Higgins et al., 2007; Martin et al., 2003ab; Woodcroft et al., 2010) and field (Falandysz et al., 2006; Falandysz et al., 2007, Furdui et al., 2007) evidence indicates that PFHxA is expected to be less bioaccumulative than PFOA and other long chain perfluoroalkyl compounds, which PFHxA-chemistry is replacing (although PFHxA and PFOA are not considered bioaccumulative).  However, both are bioavailable and can be detected in wildlife as demonstrated by monitoring studies (Kumar et al., 2009; Ye et al., 2008ab; Wang et al., 2008). In aquatic biota, there is little evidence of increased bioconcentration of PFOA compared with PFHxA although PFOA may generally be expected to be found in aquatic organisms more often than PFHxA. In general, the available evidence indicates that the bioaccumulation potential of perfluorinated compounds is correlated with increasing fluorinated carbon chain length (Giesy et al., 2010). Therefore, PFHxA has a lower bioaccumulation potential than PFOA and other long chain perfluorinated compounds, which PFHxA-based chemistry is replacing.; PEC for PFHxA and long chain perfluoroalkyl substances The notified polymer is assumed to degrade and ultimately form the persistent degradant, PFHxA. However, the yield and rate of conversion of the notified polymer to PFHxA has not been established as characterisation of the degradation products was not undertaken in the biodegradation study. Environmental monitoring data shows that PFHxA, and PFOA which PFHxA-chemistry is replacing, is widely found in the environment, particularly in fresh water close to industrial sources, but also in some biota. Water appears to be the main compartment where PFHxA is found. High measured concentrations of both PFHxA and PFOA in surface waters in Germany have been associated with the legal application of waste materials to agricultural soils (Skutlarek et al., 2006) indicating that these chemicals have the potential to enter the aquatic compartment following initial release into the soil compartment.; PFHxA and other poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances have also been found in landfill leachate, with concentrations of PFHxA ranging from 270 – 790 ng/L (Huset et al., 2011).  As landfills are reservoirs of solid waste, and receive waste water treatment plant sludge, which may contain poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances, landfills have the potential to continue to release PFHxA and homologues well into the future.; Historically, release of poly and perfluoroalkyl substances into the environment has been linked to direct releases of low molecular weight poly- and perfluoroalkyl compounds, such as poly- and perfluoroalkyl monomers during polymer manufacture and reformulation processes, rather than breakdown of the polymers themselves. In order to limit the extent of direct release of potential PFHxA precursors to the environment, it is recommended that control measures be implemented to minimise the residual weight percentage of unreacted poly- and perfluoroalkyl monomer constituents and impurities in the notified polymer to the extent practicable. Zhao et al. (2013) report that fluorotelomer alcohol (FTOH) residual raw material content in FTOH-based polymeric products is generally less than 0.1%. Efforts have also been made globally to control releases of perfluoroalkyl acids, such as PFOA and potential precursors, by reducing the presence of residual poly- and perfluoroalkyl monomers and impurities in polymers. It is recommended that the total weight of residual monomers and impurities in the notified polymer containing polyfluoroalkyl functionality should not exceed the levels attainable utilising international best practice and the levels are further reduced using available technological advances, to the extent practicable.; By reducing the presence of residual poly- and perfluoroalkyl monomers and impurities in polymers, it is expected that indirect releases from the degradation of polyfluoroalkyl substances will become a significant source of persistent poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances in the environment in the future. PFHxA is already being detected in the environment and as the long chain poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances are phased out in preference for short-chain polyfluoroalkyl chemistry containing a six-carbon perfluorohexyl moiety, the environmental levels of PFHxA are expected to increase.; Half-lives of polyfluoroalkylated polymers in aerobic soil have so far been found to be indeterminate (Russell et al., 2008; Russell et al., 2010; Washington et al, 2009). The half-lives of PFHxA in various environmental media are also unknown and its partitioning behaviour is uncertain. Further, degradation products of the notified polymer are unknown as characterisation was not undertaken in the biodegradation study. Therefore, a PEC for indirect releases of PFHxA arising from proposed use and disposal of the notified polymer in Australia cannot be determined.; Effects of PFHxA and long chain perfluorocarboxylic acids  There are only limited available toxicity data for PFHxA to organisms, and these are limited to aquatic organisms. Based on the available literature, the most sensitive trophic level is algae. Latala et al., (2009) reported the 72-hour median effect concentrations (72 h EC50) for three marine species as follows: 1.0 mg/L for blue green algae (Geitlerinema amphibium); 1.4 mg/L for diatom (Skeletonema marinoi); and, 4.0 mg/L for green algae (Chlorella vulgaris). The data indicates that PFHxA is toxic to algae on an acute basis. The study also investigated the toxicity of PFOA to the three marine species: 0.25 mg/L for blue green algae; 0.37 mg/L for diatom; and, 0.98 mg/L for green algae. The data indicates that PFOA is very toxic to algae on an acute basis and demonstrate decreased toxicity of PFHxA compared with PFOA to three species tested.; Giesy et al. (2010) reported the relationship between increasing carbon chain length and increasing toxicity. Therefore, PFHxA is expected to have a less problematic ecotoxicological profile than PFOA and other long chain perfluorocarboxylic acids it is expected to replace. Long-term effects data that reflect or model the periods over which perfluorocarboxylic acids are present in the environment are not available for PFHxA or long chain perfluorocarboxylic acids. Therefore, the long-term hazard to aquatic organisms has not been adequately established and is unknown.; Perfluoroalkyl substances are expected to be very persistent in the environment (for example, PFOA: t½ (hydrolysis) > 200 years; US EPA 2002) but PFHxA is considered to have low potential for bioaccumulation. There is limited evidence in the published literature of PFHxA toxicity to aquatic organisms on an acute basis, although it is reported to be toxic to marine algae. There is no available data on the long-term aquatic effects of PFHxA.; The main environmental risks associated with polyfluoroalkyl polymers relate to the release of perfluoroalkyl degradation products such as PFHxA. However, it is not possible to quantify the long-term risks of PFHxA to the environment due to knowledge gaps both in predicting environmental concentrations from indirect sources of release and its long-term environmental effects. . To date, the available data on environmental concentrations of PFHxA indicate a low risk of environmental toxicity. However, the long-term environmental risk profile of; However, degradants of the notified polymer, along with associated impurities and residual monomers of the notified polymer, are potential precursors of the very persistent chemical, PFHxA. The assessed use pattern of the notified polymer does not control the release of breakdown products into the environment during use and after disposal and the long-term environmental risk profile of PFHxA is currently unknown. Consequently, the long-term risk profile of the notified polymer and its degradation products is unknown. This situation may change if further data on the environmental behaviour of the notified polymer and its poly- and perfluoroalkylated degradation products (including PFHxA) were to become available.; The notified polymer is a potential precursor for PFHxA in the environment, PFHxA, is environmentally persistent and has potential to be globally distributed. However, the ecotoxicological profile and bioaccumulation potential of PFHxA is considered to be less problematic when compared with long chain (C8 and above) perfluoroalkyl acids that PFHxA is expected to replace. Nonetheless, it is recommended that the introduction and use of chemicals that degrade to release PFHxA and other very persistent poly- and perfluoroalkyl compounds should be considered a short-term measure until suitable alternatives, with less persistent chemistry, are identified.; In order to limit the extent of direct release of potential PFHxA and long chain perfluorocarboxylic acid precursors to the environment, it is recommended that control measures be implemented to minimise the residual weight percentage of unreacted polyfluoroalkyl monomer constituents and impurities in the notified polymer to the extent practicable. Where possible, the total weight of residual monomers and impurities in the notified polymer containing polyfluoroalkyl functionality should not exceed the levels attainable utilising international best practice.

Continuing release of PFHxA which has no known breakdown mechanism (at least in soil and water) could result in increasing environmental concentrations over time. Hence, there is potential for ecotoxicologically significant concentrations to eventually be reached following its accumulation in the environment. In this eventuality, precursors of PFHxA such as the notified polymer cannot be recalled after release and are a potential source of PFHxA in the environment even long after their use ceases. Thus, use and disposal of the notified polymer increases the environmental risk profile of PFHxA. The notified polymer also contains impurities which are assumed to degrade to form PFHxA.

LTD1990, The notified polymer will be used as a component of oil and water repellent paints and coatings at concentrations up to 1%.  Products containing the notified chemical are intended for industrial and commercial use only and will not be sold to the public.,"However, the notified polymer is anticipated to degrade in the environment to release fluorinated degradants similar to perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) that is known to be persistent. Due to environmental distribution of the persistent chemicals, the use of the notified polymer may lead to secondary human exposure to the fluorinated degradants via the environment. The notified polymer is proposed to replace perfluoroalkyl polymers that may release longer chain perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) in the environment. Longer chain PFCAs are known to be more hazardous to human health with higher bioaccumulation potential compared to shorter chain PFCAs. The overall human health risk posed by the notified polymer is anticipated to be less than that of the perfluoroalkyl polymers it replaces.; Environmental risk assessment On the basis of the assessed use pattern, the notified polymer itself is not considered to directly pose an unreasonable short-term risk to the environment. However, the notified polymer contains fluorinated carbon groups that have the potential to degrade to the exceptionally persistent short-chain perfluorinated carboxylic acid, PFHxA. The assessed use pattern of the notified polymer does not control the release of breakdown products into the environment during use and after disposal and the long-term environmental risk profile of PFHxA is currently unknown. Consequently, the long-term risk profile for the notified polymer and its degradation products is unknown.; The introduction and use of chemicals/polymers that release very persistent fluorinated degradants upon degradation should be considered a short-term measure until suitable alternatives, with less persistent chemistry, are identified.; The notified polymer is methacrylate-based where one of the ester side chains is polyfluorinated.

Under the NICNAS action plan for assessing and managing chemicals that could degrade to perfluorinated carboxylic acids, the notified polymer would be considered to be an indirect precursor to the exceptionally persistent perfluorinated carboxylic acid, perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) and shorter-chain perfluorinated carboxylic acid (NICNAS, b).; PFHxA is a globally distributed pollutant and is expected to be recalcitrant in the environment, potentially undergo long range transport while mainly staying in the water column.

Due to environmental distribution of the persistent chemicals, the use of the notified polymer may lead to secondary human exposure to the fluorinated degradants via the environment. The notified polymer is proposed to replace perfluoroalkyl polymers that may release longer chain perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) in the environment. Longer chain PFCAs are known to be more hazardous to human health with higher bioaccumulation potential compared to shorter chain PFCAs. The overall human health risk posed by the notified polymer is anticipated to be less than that of the perfluoroalkyl polymers it replaces.; The persistence of chemicals similar to PFHxA in the environment is of concern because they have potential to be globally distributed. Based on the currently available environmental hazard information, PFHxA is considered to have lower overall ecotoxicity concerns than homologous long-chain perfluorocarboxylic acids, which contain seven or more perfluorinated carbon atoms, such as perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA).; The environmental degradation of the notified polymer is expected to contribute to the cumulative emissions of perfluorohexanoic acid to the environment. Based on the currently available evidence, the concentrations of PFHxA and other short chain perfluorinated carboxylic acids are not considered to pose a concern for the health of the environment. However, if additional hazard information becomes available to indicate that short-chain perfluorinated carboxylic acids have hazard characteristics of high concern for the environment (such as PBT properties), then the risks posed by industrial uses of precursors to these environmental degradants may need to be re-assessed.; • The notifier should seek ways to minimise the level of residual polyfluoroalkyl monomers and impurities in the notified polymers. Such levels should be as low as practicable. Where possible, the total weight of these constituents should not exceed the levels attainable utilising international best practice.; − additional information has become available as to an adverse effect of the per- or polyfluoroalkyl degradation products of the notified polymer.; Not determined Contains perfluoroalkyl functionalities that are both hydrophobic and lipophobic; Adsorption/Desorption Not determined May have low absorption based on the presence of perfluoroalkyl functionalities which have both hydrophobic and; The notified polymer may undergo slow degradation in the environment. As such, most potential exposure to workers and the public is expected to be to the notified polymer itself, rather than to its degradation products. Exposure to the residual polyfluoroalkyl starting constituents of the notified polymer is also possible.; Hazard implication of breakdown products The notified polymer contains polyfluoroalkyl side-chains that are potential precursors of PFHxA in the environment. PFHxA is a perfluorocarboxylic acid consisting of 5 perfluorinated carbons (a short chain perfluorinated chemical). The notified polymer is proposed to replace polymers that are expected to breakdown to form degradants with perfluoroalkyl carbon chain lengths ranging from 6 to 12. It has been known that the toxicokinetic and toxicological properties of fluorinated substances are generally becoming less favourable with increase of perfluoroalkyl carbon chain length. It has also been reported that the bioaccumulation potential of perfluorocarboxylic acids increases with perfluoroalkyl carbon chain length (Conder, 2008; Giesy 2010).; A review of the literature indicates that PFHxA has a less hazardous human health profile, compared to PFOA  (NICNAS, a). It is therefore inferred that the human health hazards associated with the expected breakdown products of the notified polymer (PFHxA) are likely to be similar or less than those associated with PFOA or longer chain perfluorocarboxylic acids, which are known degradants of many perfluoroalkyl polymers currently on the market and that are intended for replacement by the notified polymer.; Workers may also be exposed to per- and polyfluoroalkyl impurities of the notified polymer at low concentrations (< 0.1%), during use. It is expected that the PPE utilised during these operations (as outlined above) will mitigate any risk associated with such exposure.; perfluoroalkyl substances (such as PFOA) that are the ultimate break down products of long chain perfluoroalkyl polymers currently in Australian commerce. In particular, it is noted that the polymer being replaced contains perfluoroalkyl carbon chain lengths > 6. It is concluded that the risks to human health from indirect exposure to breakdown products of perfluoroalkyl substances will decrease following introduction of the notified polymer, on the basis that the notified polymer is intended to replace a currently available long chain perfluoroalkyl polymers.; The notified polymer is methacrylate-based where one of the ester side chains is polyfluorinated. This polyfluorinated side-chain incorporates a chain segment of six perfluorinated carbon atoms. Under the NICNAS action plan for assessing and managing chemicals that could degrade to perfluorinated carboxylic acids, the notified polymer would be considered to be an indirect precursor to the exceptionally persistent perfluorinated carboxylic acid, perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) and shorter-chain perfluorinated carboxylic acid (NICNAS, b).; environmental biodegradation to form short-chain perfluorocarboxylic acids, including perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) (NICNAS, b).; The notified polymer will eventually degrade in landfill and has the potential to release per- and polyfluoroalkyl degradation products, including short-chain perfluorinated carboxylic acids, such as PFHxA.; PFHxA is expected to be less bioaccumulative than perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and other long-chain perfluoroalkyl acids, supported by the available laboratory (Higgins et al., 2007; Martin et al., 2003a, b; Woodcroft et al., 2010) and field (Falandysz et al., 2006; Falandysz et al., 2007, Furdui et al., 2007) evidence. In general, bioaccumulation potential decreases when the length of the perfluorinated carbon chain is decreased  (Ng and Hungerbühler, 2014, Giesy et al., 2010). The short-chain perfluorocarboxylic acids, including PFHxA, have been assessed to have low bioaccumulation potential based on the currently available information (NICNAS, b, c).; PEC for PFHxA and other perfluorocarboxylic acids The notified polymer has the potential to degrade and ultimately form the persistent degradant, PFHxA. However, the yield and rate of conversion of the notified polymer to PFHxA and shorter-chain carboxylic acids has not been established and depends on environmental conditions (microbial communities, Eh, pH, soil characteristics and climate conditions); Analyses of drinking water samples from Europe, Canada, the USA, Japan, India and China have also detected PFHxA and other short chain perfluoroalkyl compounds. PFHxA was recently detected in all samples taken from the Parramatta River (main tributary of Sydney Harbour), with a mean concentration of 2.9 ng/L. Sampling of the Brisbane River catchment following a major flooding event in 2011 also found PFHxA present in water at Somerset Dam, Wivenhoe Dam, Jindalee, Oxley Creek, West End, Bulimba and Moreton Bay. The chemical was detected in all samples obtained at these sites in concentrations ranging between 0.06 and 6.2 ng/L (NICNAS, c).; PFHxA and other poly- and perfluoroalkyl compounds have also been found in landfill leachate, with concentrations of PFHxA ranging from 270 – 790 ng/L (Huset et al., 2011). As landfills are reservoirs of solid waste, and receive waste water treatment plant sludge, which may contain poly- and perfluoroalkyl compounds,; Effects of PFHxA and other perfluorocarboxylic acids  The currently available data, summarised in the NICNAS IMAP Environment Tier II Assessment for Short-Chain Perfluorocarboxylic Acids and their Direct Precursors, indicate that PFHxA and other short-chain perfluorinated acids (i.e. those with five or fewer perfluorinated carbon atoms) have low toxicity to aquatic life (NICNAS, b, c) compared to PFOA and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) (NICNAS, d, e). However, no long-term intergenerational studies were identified for PFHxA and other short chain short-chain PFCAs. Emerging evidence suggest that the most significant aquatic toxicity effects of PFOA and PFOS may manifest in offspring when the parent generation is exposed to PFOA or PFOS (NICNAS, d, e).; However, the notified polymer has the potential to eventually degrade to form very persistent PFHxA. PFHxA is currently understood to have low potential for bioaccumulation (NICNAS, c). The currently available data also indicate that PFHxA and other short-chain perfluorocarboxylic acids and their direct precursors have low toxicity to aquatic life (NICNAS, b, c).; The main environmental risks associated with polyfluoroalkyl polymers relate to the release of perfluorinated degradation products such as PFHxA. It is not possible to quantify the release of PFHxA to the environment from the use of the notified polymer at present. However, as use of chemicals/polymers that degrade to form PFHxA increases, levels of PFHxA may build up in the environment. Hence, there is potential for environmentally significant concentrations to eventually be reached following its accumulation in the environment. In this eventuality, precursors of PFHxA such as the notified polymer cannot be recalled after release and are potential sources of PFHxA releases into the environment even long after their use ceases. Thus, use and disposal of the notified polymer will likely lead to increases in the levels of PFHxA in the environment.; The environmental degradation of the notified polymer is expected to contribute to the cumulative emissions of perfluorohexanoic acid to the environment. Based on the currently available evidence, the concentrations of PFHxA and other short-chain perfluorinated carboxylic acids are not considered to pose a concern for the health of the environment.

NA317,,,"PERFLUOROBUTANE; PERFLUOROBUTANE; 3M Australia Pty Ltd of 2-74 Dunheved Circuit, St Marys, NSW 2760 has submitted a standard notification statement accompanying their application for an assessment certificate for perfluorobutane.; Perfluoro-n-butane Decafluorobutane; GC/MS analysis of L-12336 Lot 10 revealed that it contained 99.5% perfluorobutane (MW = 238), 0.34% tetrafluoropentene (MWt=142) and 0.02% of the sample was of unknown identity (MW = 132).  Other smaller fractions were also identified.; IR Major characteristic peaks were observed at 1313, 1258, 1238, 1152 and 901, 731 cm-1, consistent with carbon-carbon stretching and carbon-fluorine stretching.  Overall the spectrum is consistent with the structure of perfluorobutane.; NMR A fluorine NMR spectrum was provided and was consistent with the expected structure of perfluorobutane.  A proton NMR was also performed and revealed 0.004% hydrogen in incompletely fluorinated molecules.; Water Solubility: 1.5 mg/L (at 1 atm perfluorobutane) by measurement of headspace pressure.  The submission also includes a QSAR estimate of more than 100 mg/L.  The solubility of the gas is estimated to be approximately 320 mg/L using Irmann's equation (1).  The low measured solubility may reflect difficulties in retaining perfluorobutane in solution: the study reports a very low vapour to water partition coefficient of 0.00034 (nearly 3000 times as much perfluorobutane will exist in the vapour phase for equal volumes of vapour and water).; < 1% hydroperfluoroalkanes; Perfluorobutane will be used to replace Halon 1301 as a clean extinguishing agent for fire and explosion protection in certain applications involving public safety and national security that require a total flooding agent.  Specific proposals are for telecommunications or computer equipment related to public safety and national security, life support function, and explosion suppression for flammable liquids and gases.  Other uses may be military crewbays and confined spaces with difficult or impossible egress where second discharge may be required.; The configuration of valves and pipes is designed for the collection of both nitrogen and perfluorobutane that may be displaced during the filling operation and minimises unintended release into the workplace.; Public exposure to the notified chemical is expected to be low.  The most likely exposure of the public to perfluorobutane is during discharge of extinguishers in the event of a fire, which does not occur very often.  Exposure of this nature may result in inhalation, and ocular and dermal contact.  It should be noted that the perfluorobutane acts to extinguish fire by eliminating oxygen, it thus has the potential to cause asphyxiation.  This extinguishing agent is to be used in industrial, military, hospital and governmental establishments.  The notified substance will not be sold direct to the public.; Environmental exposure to perfluorobutane will primarily occur through use of the agent.  No additional training is required for use of the new agent, and no significant releases are expected, other than through use or system malfunction.; As part of its product stewardship program the notifier urges users to recover agent when testing, servicing or decommissioning fire protection systems, and recycle the agent for later use or destroy it. The notifier has indicated that material recovered will be returned to its US parent company for recycling.  It is not expected that significant quantities of perfluorobutane will require disposal.  Incineration, in the presence of combustible material, in an industrial or commercial facility equipped to handle gaseous waste, is recommended should local disposal be necessary.; Given its high volatility, any perfluorobutane released to the environment will partition rapidly and almost entirely to the atmosphere.  Data provided by the notifier indicate that saturated solutions lose more than 90% of the perfluorobutane that they contain within 10 hours when stirred at ambient temperature in capped 40 mL vials containing 5 mL of solution.  It is therefore inconceivable that aquatic organisms would be exposed for significant periods to perfluorobutane, and no bioconcentration is to be expected.; Detailed atmospheric degradation pathways for perfluorobutane do not appear to have been elucidated.  However, the applicant argues that no intermediate breakdown products will enter the biosphere as the onset of degradation will occur in; For the inhalation toxicity studies with perfluorobutane, the atmosphere was not supplemented with oxygen.  For the cardiac sensitsation study oxygen was maintained at 21% v/v at concentrations of perfluorobutane above 10% v/v.; Summary of the acute toxicity of perfluorobutane; Sprague-Dawley rats (five/sex/group) were exposed (whole-body) for four hours to either an aerosol of 0 or 9.8% v/v perfluorobutane in air, or 79% v/v perfluorobutane in oxygen.  Animals were observed for 14 days.  No animals died during the study.  No clinical signs of toxicity were noted in control or perfluorobutane/air-treated rats.  During exposure the perfluorobutane/oxygen-treated rats had exaggerated respiratory movement.  Males exposed to perfluorobutane displayed reduced weight gain.  Food consumption was slightly lower for perfluorobutane rats on the day of exposure.  The lung weight to bodyweight ratios were comparable.  No treatment-related alterations to the lungs, liver or kidneys were noted.; Ten male beagle dogs were used to study the cardiac sensitisation potential of perfluorobutane via inhalation (muzzle only).  An intravenous injection of adrenaline was used before and during gas inhalation, and the effect of this injection was traced by electrocardiogram.  The response of each dog to adrenaline (2-12 µg/kg) was studied using air in the inhalation chamber and appropriate doses of adrenaline were chosen for the main study.  Trichlorofluoromethane (CFC 11), a known cardiac sensitiser as distinguished from an allergen, was used as a positive control.  The following concentrations of perfluorobutane were used: 0, 5, 10, 20, 30 or 40% v/v in air.; Dogs exposed to 2% CFC 11 in air showed a positive cardiac sensitisation response.  Dogs exposed to perfluorobutane did not show signs of cardiac sensitisation.; Albino Sprague-Dawley CD rats (ten/sex/group) were exposed (whole-body) for two weeks (six hours per day, five days per week) to either 0 or 10% v/v perfluorobutane in air.; No deaths occurred in the study.  No signs of clinical toxicity were observed.  Slightly reduced bodyweight gain, food and water consumption were noted for females exposed to perfluorobutane.  No differences in liver, kidney or lung weights were noted.  Microscopic analysis of the kidneys, lungs, heart, liver and trachea did not reveal any treatment-related alterations.; Albino Sprague-Dawley CD rats (ten/sex/group) were exposed (whole-body) for 90 days (six hours per day, five days per week) to either 0, 0.5, 1.5 or 5% v/v perfluorobutane in air.  A satellite group were exposed to either 0 or 5% v/v perfluorobutane in air for 90 days and observed for a further four weeks.; 5-80% v/v perfluorobutane in air  ± ma*; 5-80% v/v perfluorobutane in air  ± ma*; 10-80% v/v perfluorobutane in air  ± ma*; Salmonella typhimurium, strains TA 98, TA 1537, TA 1538, TA 100 and TA 1535, and Escherichia coli, strain WP2 uvrA, were exposed to 5-80% v/v perfluorobutane in air.  The plate incorporation technique was used both in the absence and presence of rat liver S9.  The rat liver microsomal fraction (S9) was prepared from male Sprague-Dawley rats that had been treated with 500 mg/kg bw of Aroclor 1254.  Air was used in the vapour phase as the negative control.  Dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) was used in the culture as the negative control.   N-Ethyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, 9-aminoacridine, 2-nitrofluorene and 2-aminoanthracene were used as positive controls.; Following exposure to perfluorobutane there were no increases in the number of revertant colonies in any of the six test strains used, either in the presence or absence of metabolic activation.  The positive controls behaved as expected.  Under the test conditions, perfluorobutane was not mutagenic in the S. typhimurium and E. coli reverse mutation assays.; Chinese hamster lung cells were exposed for six hours to 10-80% v/v perfluorobutane in air.  These experiments were performed either in the presence of or absence of metabolic activation.  Chromosomal preparations were prepared at six hours for metabolic activation and at 24 and 48 hours without metabolic activation.  For metabolic activation, a microsomal liver fraction (S9) was prepared from male Sprague-Dawley rats that had been treated with 80 mg/kg β-naphthoflavone.  Air was used in the vapour phase as the negative control.  Methyl chloride and vinyl chloride were used as positive controls in the vapour phase.  Mitomycin C and cyclophosphamide were used as positive controls in the culture medium.; Doses of up to 80% v/v perfluorobutane in air were not cytotoxic.  There were no increases in the frequency of chromosomal aberrations in perfluorobutane treated cells.  Elevated frequencies of chromosomal aberrations were found for the positive controls.; The acute inhalational toxicity of perfluorobutane in rats was low.  Oral, dermal and eye irritation studies were not provided as these tests are not applicable to gases.  Nevertheless, ophthalmoscopic observations performed during the 90 day chronic inhalation study did not provide evidence of eye irritation.  During the inhalation studies the entire body of the rat was exposed to the notified substance.  Perfluorobutane did not cause cardiac sensitisation.  Rats repeatedly exposed to perfluorobutane for up to 90 days via the inhalational route showed only marginal effects on some white blood cell parameters.  These effects were not consistent between the sexes.  Perfluorobutane did not induce gene mutation in Salmonella typhimurium or Escherichia coli.  There was no increased frequency of chromosomal aberrations in vitro in Chinese hamster lung cells exposed to perfluorobutane.  Based on the studies presented perfluorobutane is not genotoxic.; Perfluorobutane would not be classified as hazardous according to Worksafe Australia’s Approved Criteria for Classifying Hazardous Substances (10) in relation to Acute lethal effects (inhalation) or Severe effects after repeated or prolonged exposure (inhalational route).; No specific data were provided, with the omission justified by the lack of significant aquatic exposure to this volatile and sparingly soluble gas.  Perfluorocarbons are stable substances that do not exhibit significant biological activity, as exemplified by the results from testing on perfluorohexane.  The nominal 96 hour LC50 for fathead minnow exposed under static conditions to this liquid perfluorocarbon (bp 56oC) exceeded the single dose tested of 1000 mg/L (11).  The exact concentration to which fish were exposed is unclear as undissolved material remained at the bottom of the aquarium, but the perfluorocarbon clearly has no significant toxicity to fish.; Volatile halocarbons can affect the atmosphere.  The principal concern is ozone depletion.  Halon 1301 has a particularly high ozone depletion potential of 16 (12).  Perfluorobutane contains neither chlorine nor bromine, and thus will not act as a source of ozone depleting halogen radicals in the stratosphere.; As with other halocarbons, perfluorobutane emissions will increase the global warming potential of the atmosphere.  This would be of particular concern for the longer term if perfluorobutane were to be released in significant quantities, given the very long atmospheric lifetime.  However, projected import volumes are relatively low and not expected to increase significantly as the high cost of the agent and the product stewardship measures in place are expected to restrict its use to specialised applications.  Furthermore, radiative forcing is lower than might be anticipated as the infrared absorbances of perfluorocarbons occur at shorter wavelengths than for chlorofluorocarbons, in a spectral region in which less energy is radiated from the Earth because of attenuation by water and other trace gases.  The notifer estimates a global warming potential of 5500 relative to carbon dioxide over a 100 year time horizon, intermediate between those for CFC-11 (3400) and CFC-12 (7100).; Perfluorobutane is not expected to exert a direct effect on living organisms as it belongs to a class of compound, the perfluorocarbons, with negligible biological activity.  The high volatility should ensure minimal exposure of aquatic and terrestrial compartments, and therefore minimal hazard to organisms inhabiting them.; Hazard to the atmosphere will be reduced when perfluorobutane replaces the strongly ozone depleting Halon 1301, as the replacement refrigerant has negligible potential to destroy ozone.  However, the replacement retains significant global warming potential and is expected to persist in the atmosphere for millennia.; Because of the very high atmospheric persistence, perfluorobutane is considered to be an acceptable total flooding agent only in those limited instances where no other alternative is technically feasible due to performance or safety requirements.  In most total flooding applications alternatives exist.  The US EPA, for example, urges users not to select perfluorobutane out of simple preference, but out of need, and to use perfluorocarbons as the agents of last resort.  The user is responsible for determining that the requirements of the specific end-use preclude utilization of other available alternatives and for keeping records of this determination.; The notifier operates a similar product stewardship program for local users, including provision of a decision tree to determine whether perfluorobutane is the correct agent for a given situation.  Users must first determine whether a clean agent is required.  If so, the questions of whether human exposure is likely and whether use of other clean agents may approach cardiosensitisation levels or be otherwise potentially injurious to health must be addressed.  If so, perfluorobutane is the appropriate agent.  If not, technical constraints of other agents (such as their; physical and chemical properties) must still be considered to determine whether perfluorobutane is the appropriate agent.; The other main feature of the notifier’s product stewardship operations is that unwanted perfluorobutane, including that recovered from equipment maintenance or decommissioning, will be returned to the US for recycling when no longer needed.; Perfluorobutane is expected to exhibit low acute and chronic inhalational toxicity and is not likely to be genotoxic.  It is also not likely to exhibit cardiac sensitisation.; Exposure to perfluorobutane during repacking into smaller gas bottles and during fire system installation is expected to be minimal given the stringent procedures employed and the systems being designed to minimise unintended release.; Exposure to perfluorobutane is likely to be significant when there is a fire and total flooding occurs.  As fires are expected to be infrequent events, exposure to perfluorobutane is expected to be low and the gas would be expected to disperse relatively rapidly after release.; The risk of adverse occupational and public health effects resulting from transport, storage, use and disposal of perfluorobutane is expected to be low given the low hazard and likely low or infrequent exposure.  However, there is an occupational health risk of frostbite from exposure to sudden release of the compressed gas and there is a public health risk of asphyxiation if total flooding occurs in an enclosed area with limited means of egress.; To minimise occupational and environmental exposure to perfluorobutane the following guidelines and precautions should be observed:; . If engineering controls and work practices are insufficient to reduce exposure to perfluorobutane to a safe level, then personal protective devices which conform to and are used in accordance with Australian or Australian/New Zealand Standards (AS or AS/NZS) for respiratory protection (AS/NZS 1715, AS/NZS 1716) (13,14), eye protection (AS 1336, AS/NZS 1337) (15,16), impermeable gloves (AS 2161) (17) and protective clothing (AS 2919) (18) should be worn;; · Emissions of perfluorobutane should be minimised by only using the agent in accordance with the Code of Practice (19) for the Design, Installation, Inspection and Testing of Gaseous Fire Suppression Systems Utilising Ozone Depleting Substances (this requirement should appear on the Material Safety Data Sheet).  Perfluorobutane should only be used where no alternative is technically feasible due to performance or safety requirements.; · Perfluorobutane should be recovered from maintenance and decommissioning of systems that contain it for recycling, storage or destruction; and; The MSDS for perfluorobutane provided was in accordance with Worksafe Australia’s National Code of Practice for the Preparation of Material Safety Data Sheets (20).; Under the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Act 1989, secondary notification of perfluorobutane shall be required if any of the circumstances stipulated under subsection 64(2) of the Act arise.  No other specific conditions are prescribed.; 11.

The notified chemical is charged to smaller cylinders for use by fire system installers (plumbers and pipe-fitters).  The charging operation involves purging the new cylinder with nitrogen followed by introduction of the notified chemical through a transfer pump.  Progress of gas addition is measured by a weighing scale.; Fire system installation is expectd to follow design guidelines and methods accredited for use in the USA, a copy of which was provided by the notifier.  The high cost of gaining independent accreditation in Australia is likely to preclude the use of alternative procedures.  These procedures are stringent in identifying the correct hardware and design guidelines to be used and are expected to result in minimal unintended exposure to the notified chemical.; Public exposure to the notified chemical is expected to be low.

As evidence exists for combustion in flames, thermal decomposition may also occur during passage through high temperature combustors such as power plants, incinerators and internal combustion engines (3).  The estimated atmospheric lifetime is at least 2600 years.; the higher atmosphere, a high energy environment where breakdown products will not persist.

A single delivery driver will deliver sealed 20 litre pails of the notified chemical formulated into AFFF and ATC to the fire fighting agencies. Six fire fighters will handle the AFFF and ATC and dilute into an extinguisher such that the concentration of the notified chemical will be less than 0.3%. This mixture will then be applied to Class B fires with a source of AVGAS or AVTUR, after which, the liquid will be pumped from the fire pans to waste drums.; The notifier has stated that the fire fighting products, which incorporate the notified chemical, will only be tested for effectiveness, and not used as general fire fighting agents.  The efficacy testing will be carried out by fire fighting agencies.  During testing, the general public will not be exposed to the products which contain the notified chemical.; The finished products typically contain less than 5% of the notified chemical.  They are aqueous based and applied to fires with a foam-forming nozzle, with their surfactant properties used to trap fuel vapours of the liquid fuel.  This essentially smothers the fire.; Apart from the product's release to fight ""real"" fires, it will also be used in training fire- fighters in ""simulated"" situations, or in the testing of equipment.; The fate of Amphoteric Fluoroalkylamide Derivative (5965P) in fighting ""real"" fires is problematical, as it will depend on the size of the fire and the amount of water and foam needed to control the fire.  It is likely, however, that it would enter local waterways via storm water drains, road surfaces, overland flow, etc, unless bunding of the accident scene occurred.; The Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for the Acrylic Foamer formulation indicates that the chemical could decompose to products of hydrogen fluoride and oxides of carbon, sulphur and nitrogen on thermal degradation.  The chemical could partially combust or pyrolyse, but this is not likely to occur to any significant extent because of it requiring some degree of thermal stability to make it useful in fighting fires.; The chemical, Amphoteric Fluoroalkylamide Derivative (5965P), will be used as a foaming agent to fight fires that have the aviation fuels, AVGAS or AVTUR, as a fuel source.  The main environmental exposure of the chemical will occur when it is used in fire-fighting training or actual use conditions.  In the former case, conditions will be controlled, with bunding and traps preventing its release, and the release of the fuel, to the environment.  In the latter case, actual use will most likely be in areas where bunding or traps are used to prevent the release of fuel to the environment, such as airports or refineries.  At airports, for instance, drains leading from the runway area to storm water will have an interception trap to prevent release of fuel to storm water drains.; An exception to Amphoteric Fluoroalkylamide Derivative (5965P)'s use in the above situations is its use in fire-fighting on actual fires of fuel tankers or trucks carrying aviation fuels.  It is unclear how the company intends to market the material in the future, but if it is used in such events, then there is potential for the release of Amphoteric Fluoroalkylamide Derivative (5965P) to the environment.  If it is confined to use on fires involving aviation fuels only, then only a few are expected. According to the NSW EPA, these types of accidents might only amount to 3 or 4 per annum at most.  Of this, only one accident might involve a petrol tanker - the others would be trucks carrying drums of; aviation fuel.  The number of accidents in which other petroleum fuels, such as petrol, were involved would be much greater, with these fuels being recorded as the primary ignition source in more than 1000 instances according to figures from NSW Fire Brigade for 1994.; A realistic, worst case situation would, in any event, appear to be an accident involving a fuel tanker, with runoff from the accident entering a lentic (still) water body with significant wild-life.  Figures provided by the ACT Fire Brigade indicate that about 4000 L of water might be used to cool the tanker.  Another 4000 L together with the foam might be used to control any fire associated with the tanker (eg from spilt petrol and ignition of cabin material).  If the fuel load catches alight, then when the fire can be approached, more than 12000 L of water/foam mix, would be needed to control the fire.; The notifier estimates that Amphoteric Fluoroalkylamide Derivative (5965P) will be used in AFFF concentrates at about 5%.  When used, the concentrates are diluted with a foam- forming nozzle by about 3-6%, giving a concentration of about 0.15-0.3% Amphoteric Fluoroalkylamide Derivative (5965P) in the water applied to a fire.  In the above situation, the total amount of Amphoteric Fluoroalkylamide Derivative (5965P) applied would be about 0.3% x 20 x 104 L, giving 60 L of the chemical.  With a density of 1.64 g/mL, this would give 100 x 103 g of Amphoteric Fluoroalkylamide Derivative (5965P) potentially available for dispersal.  Some of this will be combusted/pyrolysed in the fire leaving the fluorinated residues, although the amount lost expected to be small.  Any Amphoteric Fluoroalkylamide Derivative (5965P) left would be associated with run-off from the accident site.  Run-off into a reasonably-sized lake of about 1 ha surface area and an average depth of 1 m (giving a volume of about 107 L) would give a concentration of 10 mg/L (100 x 103 g/107 L = 100 x 10-4 g/L or 10 mg/L).; One significant assumption is that all Amphoteric Fluoroalkylamide Derivative (5965P) applied to the fire would be associated with run-off from the accident site.  Clearly though, the run-off may not all flow into the lake, with some of the run-off absorbed by road surfaces and soil surrounding the accident site.  When and where possible, standard operating procedures of Australian fire brigades would minimise run-off by containment and removal.  Also, some losses might be expected through adsorption to sediment and particulate matter because of its surface activity.  On entering the surface waters, some Amphoteric Fluoroalkylamide Derivative (5965P) may partition to sediment, with possible (albeit slow) degradation of the hydrocarbon portion of the molecule.; With the amount of Amphoteric Fluoroalkylamide Derivative (5965P) used being potentially quite large, there is clearly a potential hazard posed by the chemical if it is allowed to contaminate surface waters.  The situations in which this might occur are, however, a rare event.  Several factors would have to be met to for Amphoteric Fluoroalkylamide Derivative (5965P) to have a major environmental impact.  These are: 1) a major accident involving a fuel tanker in which the fuel load would catch alight, 2) the run-off from the fire-fighting escaping to a lentic surface water, and 3) the concentration of Amphoteric Fluoroalkylamide Derivative (5965P) remaining near those affecting aquatic organisms for a few days.; Fire fighters may be exposed to the notified chemical through dermal contact to the skin or eyes by spillage, splashing or spray, and are expected to wear rubber gloves and chemical resistant goggles when decanting to extinguishers and normal fire fighting clothing when fighting a fire.  The exposure level of the notified chemical should be around 0.15-0.3% in the foam as applied in a fire.; The notified chemical is a surfactant which will be incorporated into products to be used by fire fighting personnel to control combustible hazards and extinguish fires involving hydrocarbon liquids.  The current application states that the notified chemical will be incorporated into fire fighting products which are to be tested by the appropriate agencies to determine their efficacy, and are not to be used for general fire control.  In addition, the chemical will be incorporated into a mist control agent to be used only by process;  it is recommended that the company clearly indicate to users the potentially hazardous nature to aquatic organisms (invertebrates and algae) of their 3M fire foam products containing Amphoteric Fluoroalkylamide Derivative (5965P);  also, if the product is used in areas in which control is not present, the company should instruct the user to bund the area to prevent run-off.; Proposals to use Amphoteric Fluoroalkylamide Derivative (5965P) in fire foams to fight fires other than those described in the application will require a secondary notification. Similarly, any proposals to use this chemical other than in controlled evaluation conditions will require a secondary notification.  No other specific conditions are prescribed."

Based on the currently available environmental hazard information, pentanoic acid, 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5-octafluoro- is considered to have lower overall ecotoxicity concerns than homologous long-chain perfluorocarboxylic acids, which contain seven or more perfluorinated carbon atoms, such as perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA).; − additional information has become available to the person as to an adverse effect of the polyfluoroalkyl degradation products of the notified chemical;; − additional information has become available to the person as to the environmental fate of the notified chemical or its polyfluoroalkyl degradation products in relation to degradation or partitioning behaviour, including during water treatment processes;; The notified chemical will eventually degrade in landfill and has the potential to release polyfluoroalkyl degradation products, including pentanoic acid, 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5-octafluoro-, which is expected to be analogous to the short-chain perfluorinated carboxylic acid perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA).; PFPeA is expected to be less bioaccumulative than perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and other long-chain perfluoroalkyl acids, supported by the available laboratory (Higgins et al., 2007; Martin et al., 2003a, b; Woodcroft et al., 2010) and field (Falandysz et al., 2006; Falandysz et al., 2007, Furdui et al., 2007) evidence. In general, bioaccumulation potential decreases when the length of the perfluorinated carbon chain is decreased  (Ng and Hungerbühler, 2014, Giesy et al., 2010). The short-chain perfluorocarboxylic acids, including PFPeA, have been assessed to have low bioaccumulation potential based on the currently available information (NICNAS, 2016a, b).; PEC for PFPeA and other perfluorocarboxylic acids The notified chemical has the potential to degrade and ultimately form the persistent degradant, pentanoic acid, 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5-octafluoro-, which is expected to be analogous to PFPeA. However, the yield and rate of conversion of the notified chemical to pentanoic acid, 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5-octafluoro- has not been established.; Monitoring of European River Rhine upstream of significant industrial sources has found PFPeA at mean concentrations of 3.65 ng/L. Concentrations of PFPeA were below 60 ng/L in river waters (Möller, et al., 2010). Similar results were obtained from water samples taken in the Upper Mississippi River Basin in the USA. Median concentrations of 0.71 ng/L were determined for PFPeA. In Spain, mean concentrations of 0.40 ng/L for PFPeA was obtained from samples taken from the Llobregat River system (Campo, et al., 2015). Analyses of drinking water samples from Europe, Canada, the USA, Japan, India and China have also detected PFPeA and other perfluorocarboxylic acids (Eschauzier, et al., 2013; Llorca, et al., 2012; Mak, et al., 2009). Limited Australian monitoring data are available for PFPeA.; Effects of PFPeA and other perfluorocarboxylic acids; The current available data, summarised in the NICNAS IMAP Environment Tier II Assessment for Short-Chain Perfluorocarboxylic Acids and their Direct Precursors, indicate that PFPeA and other short-chain perfluorinated acids (i.e. those with five or fewer perfluorinated carbon atoms) have low toxicity to aquatic life (NICNAS, 2016a,b) compared to PFOA and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) (NICNAS, 2016c,d). However, no long-term intergenerational studies were identified for pentanoic acid, 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5-octafluoro- or PFPeA and other short chain short-chain PFCAs. Emerging evidence suggest that the most significant aquatic toxicity effects of PFOA and PFOS may manifest in offspring when the parent generation is exposed to PFOA or PFOS (NICNAS, 2016c, d).; However, the notified chemical has the potential to eventually degrade to form pentanoic acid, 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5-octafluoro-, which is expected to be analogous to the very persistent chemical PFPeA.

Such levels should be as low as practicable. Where possible, the total weight of these constituents should not exceed the levels attainable utilising international best practice.; Adsorption/Desorption Not Determined May have low adsorption based on the presence of perfluoroalkyl functionalities that are known to be surface active.; The notified polymer is expected to undergo slow degradation in the environment. As such, most potential exposure to workers and the public is expected to be to the notified polymer itself, rather than to its degradation products. Exposure to the residual polyfluoroalkyl starting constituents and/or impurities of the notified polymer is also possible. Such exposure is limited by the low concentration of polyfluoroalkyl impurities in the notified polymer in the imported products and end-use products.; Hazard implication of breakdown products The notified polymer contains polyfluoroalkyl side-chains that are potential precursors of PFHxA in the environment. PFHxA is a perfluorocarboxylic acid consisting of 5 perfluorinated carbons (a short chain perfluorinated chemical). The notified polymer is proposed to replace polymers that are expected to breakdown to form degradants with perfluoroalkyl carbon chain lengths ranging from 6 to 12. It has been known that the toxicokinetic and toxicological properties of fluorinated substances are generally becoming less favourable with increase of perfluoroalkyl carbon chain length. It has also been reported that the bioaccumulation potential of perfluorocarboxylic acids increases with perfluoroalkyl carbon chain length (Conder, 2008; Giesy 2010).; A review of the literature indicates that PFHxA has a less hazardous human health profile, compared to PFOA  (NICNAS, 2015a). It is therefore inferred that the human health hazards associated with the expected breakdown products of the notified polymer (PFHxA) are likely to be similar or less than those associated with PFOA or longer chain perfluorocarboxylic acids, which are known degradants of many perfluoroalkyl polymers currently on the market and that are intended for replacement by the notified polymer.; Workers may also be exposed to per- and polyfluoroalkyl impurities of the notified polymer at low concentrations (< 0.1%), during use. It is expected that the PPE utilised during these operations (as outlined above) will mitigate any risk associated with such exposure.; The public may also be exposed to the notified polymer and low levels of per- and polyfluoroalkyl impurities from direct dermal contact with articles that have been printed with inks containing the notified polymer.  This exposure may be on a long term repeated basis. However, dermal transfer from the treated article is expected to be low as the notified polymer will be present at low concentrations and will predominantly remain absorbed to the substrate to which it was applied.  Thus, the risk to public health from repeated dermal exposure to the notified polymer from treated articles is not considered to be unreasonable. The risk to public health from long term repeated dermal exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl impurities of the notified polymer from treated articles may be mitigated by the extremely low concentrations at which they are present in end use products.; The public may be exposed indirectly to the ultimate break down product of the notified polymer, PFHxA, via the environment. Such exposure may increase over time due to the persistence of PFHxA in the environment. However, the available data indicates that PFHxA has lower bioaccumulation potential than the long chain perfluoroalkyl substances (such as PFOA) that are the ultimate break down products of long chain perfluoroalkyl polymers currently in Australian commerce. In particular, it is noted that the polymer being replaced contains perfluoroalkyl carbon chain lengths > 6. It is concluded that the risks to human health from indirect exposure to breakdown products of perfluoroalkyl substances will decrease following introduction of the notified polymer, on the basis that the notified polymer is intended to replace a currently available long chain perfluoroalkyl polymers.; The remaining 50% of the notified polymer has the potential to be released to sewer after the de-inking of printed paper during recycling processes. The notified polymer is not likely to be mobile in the environment, due to its limited solubility in water and potential to adsorb to soil and sediment, based on its expected surfactant properties. Therefore, a significant portion of the notified polymer is expected to partition to sludge during wastewater treatment processes in sewage treatment plants (STPs). Thus, very little of the notified polymer is expected to partition to the supernatant water which is released to the sewer. However, the notified polymer has the potential to bioaccumulate given the polymer is a polyfluoroalkyl polymer with significant levels (40% < 500 Da) of low molecular weight species.; The notified polymer will eventually degrade in landfill and has the potential to release per- and polyfluoroalkyl degradation products, including short-chain perfluorinated carboxylic acids, such as perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA).; PFHxA is expected to be less bioaccumulative than perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and other long-chain perfluoroalkyl acids, supported by the available laboratory (Higgins et al., 2007; Martin et al., 2003a, b; Woodcroft et al., 2010) and field (Falandysz et al., 2006; Falandysz et al., 2007, Furdui et al., 2007) evidence. In general, bioaccumulation potential decreases when the length of the perfluorinated carbon chain is decreased  (Ng and Hungerbühler, 2014, Giesy et al., 2010). The short-chain perfluorocarboxylic acids, including PFHxA, have been assessed to have low bioaccumulation potential based on the currently available information (NICNAS, 2016a, b).; PEC for PFHxA and other perfluorocarboxylic acids The notified polymer has the potential to degrade and ultimately form the persistent degradant, PFHxA. However, the yield and rate of conversion of the notified polymer to PFHxA has not been established.; Analyses of drinking water samples from Europe, Canada, the USA, Japan, India and China have also detected PFHxA and other short chain perfluoroalkyl compounds. PFHxA was recently detected in all samples taken from the Parramatta River (main tributary of Sydney Harbour), with a mean concentration of 2.9 ng/L. Sampling of the Brisbane River catchment following a major flooding event in 2011 also found PFHxA present in water at Somerset Dam, Wivenhoe Dam, Jindalee, Oxley Creek, West End, Bulimba and Moreton Bay. The chemical was detected in all samples obtained at these sites in concentrations ranging between 0.06 and 6.2 ng/L (NICNAS, 2016a).; PFHxA and other poly- and perfluoroalkyl compounds have also been found in landfill leachate, with concentrations of PFHxA ranging from 270 – 790 ng/L (Huset et al., 2011). As landfills are reservoirs of solid waste, and receive waste water treatment plant sludge, which may contain poly- and perfluoroalkyl compounds, landfills have the potential to continue to release PFHxA and homologous perfluorinated carboxylic acids well into the future.; Effects of PFHxA and other perfluorocarboxylic acids  The current available data, summarised in the NICNAS IMAP Environment Tier II Assessment for Short-Chain Perfluorocarboxylic Acids and their Direct Precursors, indicate that PFHxA and other short-chain perfluorinated acids (i.e. those with five or fewer perfluorinated carbon atoms) have low toxicity to aquatic life (NICNAS, 2016a,b) compared to PFOA and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) (NICNAS 2016c,d).

Hence, there is potential for environmentally significant concentrations to eventually be reached following its accumulation in the environment. In this eventuality, precursors of PFHxA such as the notified polymer cannot be recalled after release and are potential sources of PFHxA releases into the environment even long after their use ceases. Thus, use and disposal of the notified polymer will likely lead to increases in the levels of PFHxA in the environment.; Conclusions On the basis of the assessed use pattern, the notified polymer itself is not considered to directly pose an unreasonable short-term risk to the environment.

Due to the environmental distribution of PFHxA resulting from the use pattern of the notified polymer, secondary human exposure to PFHxA via the environment may occur. The notified polymer is replacing a long chain polyfluoroalkyl polymer, the latter of which will result in secondary human exposures to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and longer chain perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs). PFOA and longer chain PFCAs are more hazardous to human health and have higher bioaccumulation potential, compared to PFHxA (Russell et al, 2013). The overall human health risk posed by the notified polymer is less than that of the substance it replaces.; However, degradants of the notified polymer, along with associated impurities and residual monomers of the notified polymer, are potential precursors of the very persistent chemical, PFHxA. The assessed use pattern of the notified polymer does not control the release of breakdown products into the environment during use and after disposal and the long-term environmental risk profile of PFHxA is currently unknown. Consequently, the long-term risk profile for the notified polymer and its degradation products is unknown. This situation may change if further data on the environmental behaviour of the notified polymer and its poly- and perfluoroalkyl degradation products (including PFHxA) were to become available.; The notified polymer is a potential precursor for PFHxA in the environment. PFHxA is an environmentally persistent chemical that has potential to be globally distributed. However, the ecotoxicological profile and bioaccumulation potential of PFHxA is considered to be less problematic when compared with long chain (C8 and above) perfluorocarboxylic acids that PFHxA is expected to replace, noting that current evidence shows that PFHxA was not bioaccumulative in aquatic systems or humans (Russell et al, 2013). Nonetheless, the introduction and use of chemicals that degrade to release PFHxA and other very persistent poly- and perfluoroalkyl compounds should be considered a short-term measure until suitable alternatives, with less persistent chemistry, are identified.; Over time, the notified polymer is expected to become dissociated from the articles. The notified polymer has the potential to disperse in water but it is not expected to hydrolyse under environmental conditions (pH 4 to 9, 25 ºC) based on structural considerations. A test study indicates that the notified polymer is rapidly degradable, achieving 62% degradation in 28 days but failing the 10-day window criteria. Degradation products are not known for certain as no characterisation of the degradation products was undertaken in the biodegradation test. A recent paper found that close analogues of the notified polymer undergo rapid biotransformation via a chain shortening mechanism (see Exempt Information). However, the notified polymer is not expected to completely mineralise and degradation products may include more stable lower molecular weight polymers with per- and polyfluoroalkyl functionality or the very persistent perfluorinated degradation product PFHxA. Therefore, the notified polymer has the potential to release the PFHxA after only a short period of time.; In surface waters, agricultural soils and landfill, the notified polymer is expected to eventually degrade to form water, oxides of carbon and nitrogen and degradation products containing per- and polyfluoroalky functionality. The expected initial per- and polyfluoroalkyl degradation products are assumed to undergo further degradation to form, among other compounds, the very persistent perfluorinated degradation product, PFHxA. It is noted that some volatile degradation intermediates have the potential to undergo long range atmospheric transport and thus may result in translocation of PFHxA in the environment. The notified polymer also contains impurities that may degrade to form perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and other long-chain per- and polyfluorocarboxylic acids.; PFHxA is expected to be recalcitrant in the environment, and potentially undergo long range transport while mainly staying in the water column. In water, it is expected to be very persistent and will not hydrolyse, photolyse or biodegrade.; PEC for PFHxA and long chain perfluoroalkyl substances The notified polymer is assumed to degrade and ultimately form the persistent degradant, PFHxA. However, the yield and rate of conversion of the notified polymer to PFHxA has not been established as characterisation of the degradation products was not undertaken in the biodegradation study. Environmental monitoring data shows that PFHxA, and PFOA which PFHxA-chemistry is replacing, is widely found in the environment, particularly in fresh water close to industrial sources, but also in some biota. Water appears to be the main compartment where PFHxA is found. High measured concentrations of both PFHxA and PFOA in surface waters in Germany have been associated with the legal application of waste materials to agricultural soils (Skutlarek et al., 2006) indicating that these chemicals have the potential to enter the aquatic compartment following initial release into the soil compartment.; By reducing the presence of residual poly- and perfluoroalkyl monomers and impurities in polymers, it is expected that indirect releases from the degradation of polyfluoroalkyl substances will become a significant source of persistent poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances in the environment in the future. PFHxA is already being detected in the environment and as the long chain poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances are phased out in preference for short-chain polyfluoroalkyl chemistry containing a six-carbon perfluorohexyl moiety, the environmental levels of PFHxA are expected to increase.; Perfluoroalkyl substances are expected to be very persistent in the environment (for example, PFOA: t½ (hydrolysis) > 200 years; US EPA 2002) but PFHxA is considered to have low potential for bioaccumulation. There is limited evidence in the published literature of PFHxA toxicity to aquatic organisms on an acute basis, although it is reported to be toxic to marine algae. There is no available data on the long-term aquatic effects of PFHxA.; However, degradants of the notified polymer, along with associated impurities and residual monomers of the notified polymer, are potential precursors of the very persistent chemical, PFHxA.

However, the ecotoxicological profile and bioaccumulation potential of PFHxA is considered to be less problematic when compared with long chain (C8 and above) perfluoroalkyl acids that PFHxA is expected to replace.

Due to the environmental distribution of PFHxA resulting from the use pattern of the notified polymer, secondary human exposure to PFHxA via the environment may occur. The notified polymer is replacing a long chain polyfluoroalkyl polymer, the latter of which will result in secondary human exposures to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and longer chain perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs). PFOA and longer chain PFCAs are more hazardous to human health and have higher bioaccumulation potential, compared to PFHxA (Russell et al, 2013). The overall human health risk posed by the notified polymer is less than that of the substance it replaces.; However, degradants of the notified polymer, along with associated impurities and residual monomers of the notified polymer, are potential precursors of the very persistent chemical, PFHxA.

Nonetheless, the introduction and use of chemicals that degrade to release PFHxA and other very persistent poly- and perfluoroalkyl compounds should be considered a short-term measure until suitable alternatives, with less persistent chemistry, are identified.; • The notifier should seek ways to minimise the level of residual polyfluoroalkyl monomers and impurities in the notified polymer. Such levels should be as low as practicable: where possible, the total weight of these constituents should not exceed the levels attainable utilising international best practice.; − additional information has become available to the person as to an adverse effect of the poly- or perfluoroalkyl degradation products of the notified polymer (such as PFHxA);; − additional information has become available to the person as to the environmental fate of the polymer or its poly- or perfluoroalkyl degradation products (such as PFHxA) in relation to degradation or partitioning behaviour, including during water treatment processes;; Over time, the notified polymer is expected to ultimately degrade into perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) - CAS name: Hexanoic acid, 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,6-undecafluoro-; CAS No. 307-24-4.; The notified polymer is not expected to undergo significant degradation during use. As such, most potential exposure to workers and the public is expected to be to the notified polymer itself, rather than to its degradation products. Exposure to the residual polyfluoroalkyl starting constituents and/or impurities of the notified polymer (discrete polyfluoroalkyl chemicals containing perfluoroalkyl carbon chain lengths ranging from four to ten) is also possible. Such exposure is limited by the relatively low concentration of polyfluoroalkyl impurities in the notified polymer in imported products (up to 1%) and end use products (up to 0.015%).; Inhalation toxicity Perfluoroalkyl chemicals have been known to cause acute lung injury. Acute lung injury is characterised by; Toxicology of break down products The notified polymer contains perfluoroalkyl side-chains that are potential precursors of PFHxA in the environment (PFHxA; CAS No. 307-24-4), a perfluorinated chemical consisting of 5 perfluorinated carbons (a short chain perfluorinated chemical). The polymer that is proposed for replacement by the notified polymer is expected to break down to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA; CAS No. 335-67-1) (consisting of 7 perfluorinated carbons) and other per- and polyfluorocarboxylic substances with longer perfluoroalkyl carbon chain lengths. The toxicokinetic and toxicological properties of the long chain break down products are generally less favourable compared to the short chain break down products, with properties becoming less favourable with increasing perfluoroalkyl carbon chain length. In addition, it has been established that the bioaccumulation potential of perfluorocarboxylic acids increases with perfluoroalkyl carbon chain length (Conder, 2008; Giesy 2010).; A review of the literature indicates that PFHxA has a less hazardous human health profile, compared to PFOA (refer to Appendix D for details). It is therefore inferred that the human health hazards associated with the expected break down product of the notified polymer (PFHxA) are likely to be similar or less than the human health hazards associated with the expected break down products (PFOA and longer chain perfluorocarboxylic acids) of many per- and polyfluoroalkyl chemicals currently on the market and that are intended for replacement by the notified polymer.; Workers may also be exposed to per- and polyfluoroalkyl impurities of the notified polymer at relatively low concentrations (< 1%), during reformulation. It is expected that the engineering controls and personal protective equipment utilised during these operations (as outlined above) will act to mitigate any risk associated with such exposure.; The public may also be exposed to the notified polymer and low levels of per- and polyfluoroalkyl impurities from direct dermal contact with articles that have either been coated or cleaned with products containing the notified polymer.  This exposure may be on a long term repeated basis. However, dermal transfer from the treated article is expected to be low as the notified polymer will be present at low concentrations and will predominantly remain absorbed to the substrate to which it was applied.  Thus the risk to public health from repeated dermal exposure to the notified polymer from treated articles is not considered to be unreasonable. The risk to public health from long term repeated dermal exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl impurities of the notified polymer from treated articles may be mitigated by the relatively low concentrations at which they are present in end use products.; The public may be exposed indirectly to the ultimate break down product of the notified polymer, PFHxA, via the environment. Such exposure may increase over time due to the persistence of PFHxA in the environment. A quantitative risk assessment for this exposure was not conducted. However, the available data indicates that PFHxA has a more favourable toxicological profile and bioaccumulation potential than the long chain per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances that are the ultimate break down products of the majority of polyfluoroalkyl polymers currently in Australian commerce (such as PFOA). In particular, it is noted that the polymer being replaced contains perfluorinated carbon chain lengths > 6. It is concluded that the risks to human health from indirect exposure to breakdown products of polyfluoroalkyl substances will decrease following introduction of the notified polymer, on the basis that the notified polymer is intended to replace a currently available “long” chain polyfluoroalkyl polymer.; The notified polymer applied to surfaces may also degrade as a result of weathering upon being exposed to environmental conditions after use and after disposal. Degradation may result in the widespread release of degradation products such as perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) to surface waters, landfill and landfill leachates, soils, and other regions where release is not foreseen.; Some of the notified polymer may be released to sewer during reformulation, use and disposal. In general, surfactants have the potential to be removed from influent in sewage treatment plants (STP) via partitioning to phase boundaries. Predictions of the environmental partitioning behaviour of polyfluoroalkyl surfactants such as the notified polymer remain uncertain based on current knowledge because of limited data and their unique properties. In particular, the usual predictive models for partitioning during sewage treatment are inapplicable for chemicals containing perfluorinated functionality as they assume lipophilicity for hydrophobic functionality, whereas the perfluorinated functionality is both hydrophobic and lipophobic. The assumption that surface activity and/or high molecular weight results in efficient removal by sorption to sludge during conventional wastewater treatment has not been verified by supporting data for this class of chemical. Thus, noting its potential to disperse in water, a significant proportion of the notified polymer, and any associated impurities/residual monomers of poly- and perfluoroalkyl compounds, may well remain in the aqueous phase following wastewater treatment. As such, the notified polymer and the poly- and perfluoroalkyl impurities/residual monomers in wastewater have the potential to be released in STP effluent directly to surface waters or reused in the irrigation of agricultural soils throughout Australia.; Over time, the notified polymer is expected to become dissociated from the articles. The notified polymer has the potential to disperse in water but it is not expected to hydrolyse under environmental conditions (pH 4 to 9, 25 ºC) based on structural considerations. A test study indicates that the notified polymer is rapidly degradable, achieving 62% degradation in 28 days but failing the 10-day window criteria. Degradation products are not known for certain as no characterisation of the degradation products was undertaken in the biodegradation test. A recent paper found that close analogues of the notified polymer undergo rapid biotransformation via a chain shortening mechanism (see Exempt Information). However, the notified polymer is not expected to completely mineralise and degradation products may include more stable lower molecular weight polymers with per- and polyfluoroalkyl functionality or the very persistent perfluorinated degradation product PFHxA. Therefore, the notified polymer has the potential to release the PFHxA after only a short period of time.; In surface waters, agricultural soils and landfill, the notified polymer is expected to eventually degrade to form water, oxides of carbon and nitrogen and degradation products containing per- and polyfluoroalky functionality. The expected initial per- and polyfluoroalkyl degradation products are assumed to undergo further degradation to form, among other compounds, the very persistent perfluorinated degradation product, PFHxA. It is noted that some volatile degradation intermediates have the potential to undergo long range atmospheric transport and thus may result in translocation of PFHxA in the environment. The notified polymer also contains impurities that may degrade to form perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and other long-chain per- and polyfluorocarboxylic acids.; High-temperature incineration is the preferred method of disposal of poly- and perfluoroalkyl compounds due to the environmental persistence characteristics, when it results in mineralisation of the perfluoralkyl functionality to oxides of carbon and hydrofluoric acid. Incomplete combustion of perfluoralkyl functionality may produce an array of partially oxidised fluorocompounds such as perfluoroacetic acid, fluorinated dioxins and furans. Therefore, disposal of the notified polymer and its degradation products by incineration should only take place at facilities that demonstrate complete combustion of the perfluoroalkyl functionality and have adequate measures in place to control release of hydrofluoric acid.; The notified polymer has the potential to bioaccumulate based on its molecular weight and n-octanol/water partition coefficient. Generally, a log Pow of > 4.2 indicates a potential for bioaccumulation as high values indicate a tendency to partition to lipids while a low value indicates a tendency to partition to water. However, this also assumes lipophilicity of the hydrophobic functionality which does not apply to perfluoroalkyl functionality. Certain perfluoroalkyl compounds are known to accumulate in the blood and liver rather than lipids in biological systems (Danish EPA, 2008). As perfluoroalkyl compounds do not follow the usual mechanism for bioaccumulation and are not expected to bioaccumulate in lipids, and because of the notified polymer’s surface-active properties, the n-octanol-water partition coefficient is not considered to be a reliable indicator of bioaccumulation potential for the notified polymer. Further, the notified polymer has the potential; The available laboratory (Higgins et al., 2007; Martin et al., 2003ab; Woodcroft et al., 2010) and field (Falandysz et al., 2006; Falandysz et al., 2007, Furdui et al., 2007) evidence indicates that PFHxA is expected to be less bioaccumulative than PFOA and other long chain perfluoroalkyl compounds, which PFHxA-chemistry is replacing (although PFHxA and PFOA are not considered bioaccumulative).  However, both are bioavailable and can be detected in wildlife as demonstrated by monitoring studies (Kumar et al., 2009; Ye et al., 2008ab; Wang et al., 2008). In aquatic biota, there is little evidence of increased bioconcentration of PFOA compared with PFHxA although PFOA may generally be expected to be found in aquatic organisms more often than PFHxA. In general, the available evidence indicates that the bioaccumulation potential of perfluorinated compounds is correlated with increasing fluorinated carbon chain length (Giesy et al., 2010). Therefore, PFHxA has a lower bioaccumulation potential than PFOA and other long chain perfluorinated compounds, which PFHxA-based chemistry is replacing.; PEC for PFHxA and long chain perfluoroalkyl substances The notified polymer is assumed to degrade and ultimately form the persistent degradant, PFHxA. However, the yield and rate of conversion of the notified polymer to PFHxA has not been established as characterisation of the degradation products was not undertaken in the biodegradation study. Environmental monitoring data shows that PFHxA, and PFOA which PFHxA-chemistry is replacing, is widely found in the environment, particularly in fresh water close to industrial sources, but also in some biota. Water appears to be the main compartment where PFHxA is found. High measured concentrations of both PFHxA and PFOA in surface waters in Germany have been associated with the legal application of waste materials to agricultural soils (Skutlarek et al., 2006) indicating that these chemicals have the potential to enter the aquatic compartment following initial release into the soil compartment.; PFHxA and other poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances have also been found in landfill leachate, with concentrations of PFHxA ranging from 270 – 790 ng/L (Huset et al., 2011).  As landfills are reservoirs of solid waste, and receive waste water treatment plant sludge, which may contain poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances, landfills have the potential to continue to release PFHxA and homologues well into the future.; Historically, release of poly and perfluoroalkyl substances into the environment has been linked to direct releases of low molecular weight poly- and perfluoroalkyl compounds, such as poly- and perfluoroalkyl monomers during polymer manufacture and reformulation processes, rather than breakdown of the polymers themselves. In order to limit the extent of direct release of potential PFHxA precursors to the environment, it is recommended that control measures be implemented to minimise the residual weight percentage of unreacted poly- and perfluoroalkyl monomer constituents and impurities in the notified polymer to the extent practicable. Zhao et al. (2013) report that fluorotelomer alcohol (FTOH) residual raw material content in FTOH-based polymeric products is generally less than 0.1%. Efforts have also been made globally to control releases of; perfluoroalkyl acids, such as PFOA and potential precursors, by reducing the presence of residual poly- and perfluoroalkyl monomers and impurities in polymers. It is recommended that the total weight of residual monomers and impurities in the notified polymer containing polyfluoroalkyl functionality should not exceed the levels attainable utilising international best practice and the levels are further reduced using available technological advances, to the extent practicable.; By reducing the presence of residual poly- and perfluoroalkyl monomers and impurities in polymers, it is expected that indirect releases from the degradation of polyfluoroalkyl substances will become a significant source of persistent poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances in the environment in the future. PFHxA is already being detected in the environment and as the long chain poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances are phased out in preference for short-chain polyfluoroalkyl chemistry containing a six-carbon perfluorohexyl moiety, the environmental levels of PFHxA are expected to increase.; Half-lives of polyfluoroalkylated polymers in aerobic soil have so far been found to be indeterminate (Russell et al., 2008; Russell et al., 2010; Washington et al, 2009). The half-lives of PFHxA in various environmental media are also unknown and its partitioning behaviour is uncertain. Further, degradation products of the notified polymer are unknown as characterisation was not undertaken in the biodegradation study. Therefore, a PEC for indirect releases of PFHxA arising from proposed use and disposal of the notified polymer in Australia cannot be determined.; Effects of PFHxA and long chain perfluorocarboxylic acids  There are only limited available toxicity data for PFHxA to organisms, and these are limited to aquatic organisms. Based on the available literature, the most sensitive trophic level is algae. Latala et al., (2009) reported the 72-hour median effect concentrations (72 h EC50) for three marine species as follows: 1.0 mg/L for blue green algae (Geitlerinema amphibium); 1.4 mg/L for diatom (Skeletonema marinoi); and, 4.0 mg/L for green algae (Chlorella vulgaris). The data indicates that PFHxA is toxic to algae on an acute basis. The study also investigated the toxicity of PFOA to the three marine species: 0.25 mg/L for blue green algae; 0.37 mg/L for diatom; and, 0.98 mg/L for green algae. The data indicates that PFOA is very toxic to algae on an acute basis and demonstrate decreased toxicity of PFHxA compared with PFOA to three species tested.; Therefore, PFHxA is expected to have a less problematic ecotoxicological profile than PFOA and other long chain perfluorocarboxylic acids it is expected to replace. Long-term effects data that reflect or model the periods over which perfluorocarboxylic acids are present in the environment are not available for PFHxA or long chain perfluorocarboxylic acids. Therefore, the long-term hazard to aquatic organisms has not been adequately established and is unknown.; Perfluoroalkyl substances are expected to be very persistent in the environment (for example, PFOA: t½ (hydrolysis) > 200 years; US EPA 2002) but PFHxA is considered to have low potential for bioaccumulation. There is limited evidence in the published literature of PFHxA toxicity to aquatic organisms on an acute basis, although it is reported to be toxic to marine algae. There is no available data on the long-term aquatic effects of PFHxA.; The main environmental risks associated with polyfluoroalkyl polymers relate to the release of perfluoroalkyl degradation products such as PFHxA. However, it is not possible to quantify the long-term risks of PFHxA to the environment due to knowledge gaps both in predicting environmental concentrations from indirect sources of release and its long-term environmental effects. . To date, the available data on environmental concentrations of PFHxA indicate a low risk of environmental toxicity. However, the long-term environmental risk profile of PFHxA is currently unknown, and further long term research should ideally be undertaken to characterise this risk.; However, degradants of the notified polymer, along with associated impurities and residual monomers of the notified polymer, are potential precursors of the very persistent chemical, PFHxA. The assessed use pattern of the notified polymer does not control the release of breakdown products into the environment during use and after disposal and the long-term environmental risk profile of PFHxA is currently unknown. Consequently, the long-term risk profile of the notified polymer and its degradation products is unknown. This situation may change if further data on the environmental behaviour of the notified polymer and its poly- and perfluoroalkylated degradation products (including PFHxA) were to become available.; The notified polymer is a potential precursor for PFHxA in the environment, PFHxA, is environmentally persistent and has potential to be globally distributed. However, the ecotoxicological profile and bioaccumulation potential of PFHxA is considered to be less problematic when compared with long chain (C8 and above) perfluoroalkyl acids that PFHxA is expected to replace. Nonetheless, it is recommended that the introduction and use of chemicals that degrade to release PFHxA and other very persistent poly- and perfluoroalkyl compounds should be considered a short-term measure until suitable alternatives, with less persistent chemistry, are identified.; In order to limit the extent of direct release of potential PFHxA and long chain perfluorocarboxylic acid precursors to the environment, it is recommended that control measures be implemented to minimise the residual weight percentage of unreacted polyfluoroalkyl monomer constituents and impurities in the notified polymer to the extent practicable. Where possible, the total weight of residual monomers and impurities in the notified polymer containing polyfluoroalkyl functionality should not exceed the levels attainable utilising international best practice. It is recommended that the levels remain within this range and are further reduced using available technological advances, to the extent practicable.; APPENDIX D: TOXICOLOGY OF PERFLUOROHEXANOIC ACID (PFHXA); AGC Chemicals (2010) A 24-month Oral (Gavage) Combined Chronic Toxicity/Carcinogenicity Study of Perfluorohexanoic Acid (PFHxA) in Rats (Study no.

Continuing release of PFHxA which has no known breakdown mechanism (at least in soil and water) could result in increasing environmental concentrations over time. Hence, there is potential for ecotoxicologically significant concentrations to eventually be reached following its accumulation in the environment. In this eventuality, precursors of PFHxA such as the notified polymer cannot be recalled after release and are a potential source of PFHxA in the environment even long after their use ceases. Thus, use and disposal of the notified polymer increases the environmental risk profile of PFHxA. The notified polymer also contains impurities which are assumed to degrade to form PFHxA.

The expected initial perfluoroalkyl degradation products are assumed to undergo further degradation to form, among other compounds, the very persistent perfluorocarboxylic acid, PFHxA. It is noted that some volatile degradation intermediates have the potential to undergo long range atmospheric transport and thus may result in translocation of PFHxA in the environment. The notified polymer also contains low levels of impurities that may degrade to form PFOA and other long-chain perfluorocarboxylic acids.; PFHxA is expected to be recalcitrant in the environment, and potentially undergo long range transport while mainly staying in the water column. In water, it is expected to be very persistent and will not hydrolyse, photolyse or biodegrade.; PEC for PFHxA and long chain perfluoroalkyl substances The notified polymer is assumed to degrade and ultimately form the persistent degradant, PFHxA. However, the yield and rate of conversion of the notified polymer to PFHxA has not been established as characterisation of the degradation products was not undertaken in the biodegradation study on an analogue polymer. Environmental monitoring data shows that PFHxA and PFOA is widely found in the environment, particularly in fresh water close to industrial sources, but also in some biota. Water appears to be the main compartment where PFHxA is found. High measured concentrations of both PFHxA and PFOA in surface waters in Germany have been associated with the application of waste materials to agricultural soils (Skutlarek et al., 2006) indicating that these chemicals have the potential to enter the aquatic compartment following initial release into the soil compartment.; By reducing the presence of residual poly- and perfluoroalkyl monomers and impurities in polymers, it is expected that indirect releases from the degradation of polyfluoroalkyl substances will become a significant source of persistent poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances in the environment in the future. PFHxA is already being detected in the environment and as the long chain poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances are phased out in preference for short-chain polyfluoroalkyl chemistry containing a six-carbon perfluorohexyl moiety, the environmental levels of PFHxA are expected to increase.; Perfluoroalkyl substances are expected to be very persistent in the environment (for example, PFOA: t½ (hydrolysis) > 200 years; US EPA, 2002) but PFHxA is considered to have low potential for bioaccumulation. There is limited evidence in the published literature of PFHxA toxicity to aquatic organisms on an acute basis, although it is reported to be toxic to marine algae.

PFHxA is an environmentally persistent chemical that has potential to be globally distributed. However, the ecotoxicological profile and bioaccumulation potential of PFHxA is considered to be less problematic when compared with long chain (C8 and above) perfluorocarboxylic acids that PFHxA is expected to replace, noting that current evidence suggests PFHxA is not bioaccumulative in aquatic ecosystems. Nonetheless, the introduction and use of chemicals that degrade to release PFHxA and other very persistent poly- and perfluoroalkyl compounds should be considered a short-term measure until suitable alternatives, with less persistent chemistry, are identified.; • The notified polymer should only be introduced as part of a strategy to phase out the use of long chain polyfluoroalkyl chemicals.; • The notifier should seek ways to minimise the level of residual polyfluoroalkyl monomers and impurities in the notified polymer. Such levels should be as low as practicable: where possible, the total weight of these constituents should not exceed the levels attainable utilising international best practice.; • If the notified polymer or products containing the notified polymer cannot feasibly be disposed using a technique that will destroy or irreversibly transform the perfluoroalkyl components of the notified polymer, disposal should be to landfill.; − additional information has become available to the person as to an adverse effect of the polyfluoroalkyl degradation products of the notified polymer (such as perfluorohexanoic acid);; − additional information has become available to the person as to the environmental fate of the polymer or its polyfluoroalkyl degradation products (such as perfluorohexanoic acid) in relation to degradation or partitioning behaviour, including during water treatment processes;; The notified polymer contains a polyfluoroalkyl carbon side chain with six perfluorinated carbon atoms.; The notified polymer is a potential precursor for PFHxA in the environment  (PFHxA; perfluorohexanoic acid - CAS name: Hexanoic acid, 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,6-undecafluoro-; CAS No. 307-24-4).; Adsorption/Desorption Not determined Generally, non-ionic polymers of high molecular weight are expected to adsorb to soil, sediments and sludge. However, the notified polymer may have low absorption based on the presence of perfluoroalkyl; The notified polymer may undergo slow degradation in the environment. As such, most potential exposure to workers and the public is expected to be to the notified polymer itself, rather than to its degradation products. Exposure to the residual polyfluoroalkyl starting constituents and/or impurities of the notified polymer (discrete polyfluoroalkyl chemicals containing perfluoroalkyl carbon chain lengths ranging from four to ten) is also possible. Such exposure is limited by the relatively low concentration of polyfluoroalkyl impurities in the notified polymer in the imported products or in end-use products.; The notified polymer is a potential precursor for perfluorohexanoic acid in the environment. This is likely to lead to secondary human exposure to PFHxA. This exposure is unquantifiable.; Toxicology of break down products The notified polymer contains perfluoroalkyl side-chains that are potential precursors of PFHxA in the environment (PFHxA; CAS No. 307-24-4). PFHxA is a perfluorocarboxylic acid consisting of 5 perfluorinated carbons (a short chain perfluorinated chemical). The polymer that is proposed for replacement by the notified polymer is expected to break down to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA; CAS No. 335-67-1) (consisting of 7 perfluorinated carbons) and other per- and polyfluorocarboxylic chemicals with longer perfluoroalkyl carbon chain lengths. The toxicokinetic and toxicological properties of the long chain break down products are generally less favourable compared to the short chain break down products, with properties becoming less favourable with increasing perfluoroalkyl carbon chain length. In addition, it has been established that the bioaccumulation potential of perfluorocarboxylic acids increases with perfluoroalkyl carbon chain length (Conder, 2008; Giesy, 2010).; A review of the literature indicates that PFHxA has a less hazardous human health profile, compared to PFOA (refer to Appendix D for details). It is therefore inferred that the human health hazards associated with the expected break down product of the notified polymer (PFHxA) are likely to be similar or less than the human health hazards associated with the expected break down products (PFOA and longer chain perfluorocarboxylic acids) of many per- and polyfluoroalkyl chemicals currently on the market and that are intended for replacement by the notified polymer.; Workers may also be exposed to perfluoroalkyl starting constituents and/or impurities of the notified polymer at relatively low concentrations during reformulation and end use operations. It is expected that the engineering controls and personal protective equipment utilised during these operations (as outlined above) will act to mitigate any risk associated with such exposure.; Leather and textile treatments and stone and tile products containing the notified polymer (up to 2% concentration) will be applied by brush or foam swab. Products containing the notified chemical at concentrations ≤ 1.2% may also be applied by aerosol spray or low pressure spray. Public exposure will be less frequent than that experienced by professional users, and hence the lack of repeated dose inhalation data for the notified polymer is of less concern based on the expected infrequent use of the products. The acute inhalation exposure following spraying from aerosol cans can be estimated, based on data from a polyfluorinated analogue, to be 0.16 – 0.48 mg/m3. Using the NOAEC (histopathology) from an acute inhalation study in rats which was 25 mg/m3/4 hours would give a margin of exposure (MoE) of 156 – 52. At the lower end of 52 this MoE would be unacceptable. However, the smaller exposure concentration value (0.16 mg/m3) and corresponding higher MoE of 156 represents the more realistic but still conservative use of a whole spray can on a small surface area, whereas the higher exposure concentration was for the use of three cans over the same time length.  Additionally the exposure was measured in a small volume of air with no air exchange and does not factor in the potential use of PPE. The risk to public health from use of the notified polymer in sprays (up to 1.2% concentration) is not considered to be unreasonable, based on the infrequent and short-term exposure. Additionally, the risk to public health from exposures to perfluoroalkyl impurities is not considered to be unreasonable based on their relatively low concentration (< 0.01%) in end-use products.; The public may also be exposed to the notified polymer and low levels of perfluoroalkyl impurities from direct dermal contact with treated articles (after drying onto the article), such as leather and textile products and stones and tiles. This exposure may be on a long term repeated basis. However, based on the high molecular weight of the notified polymer (> 10,000 Da) and the low proportion of low molecular weight species, dermal absorption of the notified polymer is unlikely to occur. Thus the risk to public health from repeated dermal exposure to the notified polymer from treated articles is not considered to be unreasonable. The risk to public health from long term repeated dermal exposure to perfluoroalkyl impurities of the notified polymer from treated articles may be mitigated by the relatively low concentrations at which they are present.; The public may be exposed indirectly to PFHxA, formed by degradation of the notified polymer in the environment. Such exposure may increase over time due to the persistence of PFHxA in the environment. A quantitative risk assessment for this exposure was not conducted. However, the available data indicates that PFHxA has a more favourable toxicological profile and bioaccumulation potential than the long chain perfluoroalkyl substances that are the ultimate break down products of the majority of perfluoroalkyl polymers currently in Australian commerce (such as PFOA). In particular, it is noted that the polymer being replaced contains perfluoroalkyl carbon chain lengths > 6. It is concluded that the risks to human health from indirect exposure to breakdown products of perfluoroalkyl substances will decrease following introduction of the notified polymer, on the basis that the notified polymer is intended to replace a currently available “long” chain perfluoroalkyl polymer.; Some of the notified polymer may be released to sewer during reformulation, use and disposal. Non-ionic polymers with a molecular weight of more than 1000 Da are generally considered to be efficiently removed in sewage treatment plant (STP) processes through adsorption to sludge. Predictions of the environmental partitioning behaviour of polyfluoroalkyl polymers remain uncertain based on current knowledge because of limited data and their unique properties. In particular, the usual predictive models for partitioning during sewage treatment are inapplicable for chemicals containing perfluoroalkyl functionality as they assume lipophilicity for hydrophobic functionality, whereas the perfluoroalkyl functionality is both hydrophobic and lipophobic. The assumption that high molecular weight results in efficient removal by sorption to sludge during conventional wastewater treatment has not been verified by supporting data for this class of chemical. Thus, noting its potential of being both hydrophobic and lipophobic, the notified polymer, and any associated degradation products and/or impurities/residual monomers of poly- or perfluoroalkyl compounds, may remain in the aqueous phase following wastewater treatment. As such, the notified polymer, its degradation products and the poly- or perfluoroalkyl impurities/residual monomers in wastewater have the potential to be released in STP effluent directly to surface waters or reused in the irrigation of agricultural soils throughout Australia.; In surface waters, agricultural soils and landfill, the notified polymer is expected to eventually degrade to form water, oxides of carbon and nitrogen and degradation products containing polyfluoroalkyl functionality. The expected initial perfluoroalkyl degradation products are assumed to undergo further degradation to form, among other compounds, the very persistent perfluorocarboxylic acid, PFHxA. It is noted that some volatile degradation intermediates have the potential to undergo long range atmospheric transport and thus may result in translocation of PFHxA in the environment. The notified polymer also contains low levels of impurities that may degrade to form PFOA and other long-chain perfluorocarboxylic acids.; High-temperature incineration is the preferred method of disposal of poly- and perfluoroalkyl compounds due to the environmental persistence characteristics, when it results in mineralisation of the perfluoralkyl functionality to oxides of carbon and hydrofluoric acid. Incomplete combustion of perfluoralkyl functionality may produce an array of partially oxidised fluorocompounds. Therefore, disposal of the notified polymer and its degradation products by incineration should only take place at facilities that demonstrate complete combustion of the perfluoroalkyl functionality and have adequate measures in place to control release of hydrofluoric acid.; Due to its high molecular weight which limits the ability to cross biological membranes, the notified polymer is not expected to bioaccumulate. The available laboratory (Higgins et al., 2007; Martin et al., 2003ab; Woodcroft et al., 2010) and field (Falandysz et al., 2006; Falandysz et al., 2007, Furdui et al., 2007) evidence indicates that PFHxA is expected to be less bioaccumulative than PFOA and other long chain perfluoroalkyl compounds, which PFHxA-chemistry is replacing (though PFHxA and PFOA, are not considered bioaccumulative). However, both are bioavailable and can be detected in wildlife as demonstrated by monitoring studies (Kumar et al., 2009; Ye et al., 2008ab; Wang et al., 2008). In aquatic biota, there is little evidence of increased bioconcentration of PFOA compared with PFHxA although PFOA may generally be expected to be found in aquatic organisms more often than PFHxA. In general, the available evidence indicates that the bioaccumulation potential of perfluoroalkyl compounds is correlated with increasing carbon chain length (Giesy et al., 2010). Therefore, PFHxA has a lower bioaccumulation potential than PFOA and other long chain perfluoroalkyl substances.; PEC for PFHxA and long chain perfluoroalkyl substances The notified polymer is assumed to degrade and ultimately form the persistent degradant, PFHxA. However, the yield and rate of conversion of the notified polymer to PFHxA has not been established as characterisation of the degradation products was not undertaken in the biodegradation study on an analogue polymer. Environmental monitoring data shows that PFHxA and PFOA is widely found in the environment, particularly in fresh water close to industrial sources, but also in some biota. Water appears to be the main compartment where PFHxA is found. High measured concentrations of both PFHxA and PFOA in surface waters in Germany have been associated with the application of waste materials to agricultural soils (Skutlarek et al., 2006) indicating that these chemicals have the potential to enter the aquatic compartment following initial release into the soil compartment.; PFHxA and other poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances have also been found in landfill leachate, with concentrations of PFHxA ranging from 270 – 790 ng/L (Huset et al., 2011). As landfills are reservoirs of solid waste, and receive waste water treatment plant sludge, which may contain poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances, landfills have the potential to continue to release PFHxA and homologues well into the future.; Historically, release of poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances into the environment has been linked to direct releases of low molecular weight poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances, such as poly- and perfluoroalkyl monomers during polymer manufacture and reformulation processes, rather than breakdown of the polymers themselves. In order to limit the extent of direct release of potential PFHxA precursors to the environment, it is recommended that control measures be implemented to minimise the residual weight percentage of unreacted poly- and perfluoroalkyl monomer constituents and impurities in the notified polymer to the extent practicable. Zhao et al. (2013) report that fluorotelomer alcohol (FTOH) residual raw material content in FTOH-based polymeric products is generally less than 0.1%. Efforts have also been made globally to control releases of perfluoroalkyl acids, such as PFOA and potential precursors, such as by reducing the presence of residual poly- and perfluoroalkyl monomers and impurities in polymers. It is recommended that the total weight of residual monomers and impurities in the notified polymer containing polyfluoroalkyl functionality should not exceed the levels attainable utilising international best practice and that the levels are further reduced using available technological advances, to the extent practicable.; By reducing the presence of residual poly- and perfluoroalkyl monomers and impurities in polymers, it is expected that indirect releases from the degradation of polyfluoroalkyl substances will become a significant source of persistent poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances in the environment in the future. PFHxA is already being detected in the environment and as the long chain poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances are phased out in preference for short-chain polyfluoroalkyl chemistry containing a six-carbon perfluorohexyl moiety, the environmental levels of PFHxA are expected to increase.; Half-lives of polyfluoroalkyl polymers in aerobic soil have been found to be indeterminate with calculated half-lives ranging from decades to millennia (Russell et al., 2008; Russell et al., 2010; Washington et al, 2009). The half-lives of PFHxA in various environmental media are unknown and its partitioning behaviour is uncertain. Further, degradation products of the notified polymer are unknown as characterisation was not undertaken in the biodegradation study. Therefore, a PEC for indirect releases of PFHxA arising from proposed use and disposal of the notified polymer in Australia cannot be determined.; Effects of PFHxA and long chain perfluorocarboxylic acids  There are only limited available toxicity data for PFHxA to organisms, and these are limited to aquatic organisms. Based on the available literature, the most sensitive trophic level is algae. Latala et al. (2009) reported the 72-hour median effect concentrations (72 h EC50) for three marine species as follows: 1.0 mg/L for blue green algae (Geitlerinema amphibium); 1.4 mg/L for diatom (Skeletonema marinoi); and, 4.0 mg/L for green algae (Chlorella vulgaris). The data indicates that PFHxA is toxic to algae on an acute basis. The study also investigated the toxicity of PFOA to the three marine species: 0.25 mg/L for blue green algae; 0.37 mg/L for diatom; and, 0.98 mg/L for green algae. The data indicates that PFOA is very toxic to algae on an acute basis and demonstrate decreased toxicity of PFHxA compared with PFOA to the three species tested.; Giesy et al. (2010) reported the relationship between increasing carbon chain length and increasing toxicity. Therefore, PFHxA is expected to have a less problematic ecotoxicological profile than PFOA and other long chain perfluorocarboxylic acids it is expected to replace. Long-term effects data that reflect or model the periods over which perfluorocarboxylic acids are present in the environment are not available for PFHxA or long chain perfluorocarboxylic acids. Therefore, the long-term hazard to aquatic organisms has not been fully characterised.; Perfluoroalkyl substances are expected to be very persistent in the environment (for example, PFOA: t½ (hydrolysis) > 200 years; US EPA, 2002) but PFHxA is considered to have low potential for bioaccumulation. There is limited evidence in the published literature of PFHxA toxicity to aquatic organisms on an acute basis, although it is reported to be toxic to marine algae. There is no available data on the long-term aquatic effects of PFHxA.; The main environmental risks associated with polyfluoroalkyl polymers relate to the release of perfluoroalkyl degradation products such as PFHxA. However, it is not possible to quantify the long-term risks of PFHxA to the environment due to knowledge gaps both in predicting environmental concentrations from indirect sources of release and its long-term environmental effects. The latter point is considered a critical data gap as aquatic organisms are expected to have long-term exposure to PFHxA due to its persistence in the water compartment.; However, degradants of the notified polymer, along with associated impurities and residual monomers of the notified polymer, are potential precursors of the very persistent chemical, PFHxA. The assessed use pattern of the notified polymer does not control the release of breakdown products into the environment during use and after disposal and there are no adequate long-term environmental effects data for PFHxA. Therefore, the long-term environmental implications are unknown. Consequently, the long-term risk cannot be quantified for the notified polymer and its degradation products. In order to inform a more conclusive assessment of long-term environmental risks, further data should be generated. This may include data on longer-term environmental effects, as well as partitioning behaviour and characterisation of the degradation products, for the notified polymer and/or poly- and perfluoroalkyl degradation products (including PFHxA).; The assumed major degradation product, PFHxA, is environmentally persistent and has potential to be globally distributed. However, the ecotoxicological profile and bioaccumulation potential of PFHxA is considered to be less problematic when compared with long chain (C8 and above) perfluoroalkyl acids that PFHxA is expected to replace. Nonetheless, the introduction and use of chemicals that degrade to release PFHxA and other very persistent poly- and perfluoroalkyl compounds should be considered a short-term measure until suitable alternatives, with less persistent chemistry, are identified.; In order to limit the extent of direct release of potential PFHxA and long chain perfluorocarboxylic acid precursors to the environment, it is recommended that control measures be implemented to minimise the residual weight percentage of unreacted polyfluoroalkyl monomer constituents and impurities in the notified polymer to the extent practicable. Where possible, the total weight of residual monomers and impurities of the notified polymer containing polyfluoroalkyl functionality should not exceed the levels attainable utilising international best practice. It is recommended that the levels remain within this range and are further reduced using available technological advances, to the extent practicable.; APPENDIX D: TOXICOLOGY OF PERFLUOROHEXANOIC ACID (PFHXA); AGC Chemicals (2010) A 24-month oral (gavage) combined chronic toxicity/carcinogenicity study of perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) in rats (Study no.

The recommended hazard classification is presented in the following table.; Historically, release of poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances into the environment has been linked to direct releases of low molecular weight poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances, such as poly- and perfluoroalkyl monomers during polymer manufacture and reformulation processes, rather than breakdown of the polymers themselves. In order to limit the extent of direct release of potential PFHxA precursors to the environment, it is recommended that control measures be implemented to minimise the residual weight percentage of unreacted poly- and perfluoroalkyl monomer constituents and impurities in the notified polymer to the extent practicable. Zhao et al. (2013) report that fluorotelomer alcohol (FTOH) residual raw material content in FTOH-based polymeric products is generally less than 0.1%. Efforts have also been made globally to control releases of perfluoroalkyl acids, such as PFOA and potential precursors, such as by reducing the presence of residual poly- and perfluoroalkyl monomers and impurities in polymers. It is recommended that the total weight of residual monomers and impurities in the notified polymer containing polyfluoroalkyl functionality should not exceed the levels attainable utilising international best practice and that the levels are further reduced using available technological advances, to the extent practicable.; PFHxA is already wide-spread in surface waters and biota. Continuing release of PFHxA which has no known breakdown mechanism (at least in soil and water) could result in increasing environmental concentrations over time. Hence, there is potential for ecotoxicologically significant concentrations to eventually be reached following its accumulation in the environment. In this eventuality, precursors of PFHxA such as the notified polymer cannot be recalled after release and are a potential source of PFHxA in the environment even long after their use ceases. Thus, use and disposal of the notified polymer increases the environmental risk profile of PFHxA. The notified polymer also contains impurities which are assumed to degrade to form PFHxA. Therefore, considering the dispersive use pattern of the notified polymer, it is recommended to reduce the impurities in the notified polymer that breakdown to form PFHxA, to the extent possible.; In order to limit the extent of direct release of potential PFHxA and long chain perfluorocarboxylic acid precursors to the environment, it is recommended that control measures be implemented to minimise the residual weight percentage of unreacted polyfluoroalkyl monomer constituents and impurities in the notified polymer to the extent practicable. Where possible, the total weight of residual monomers and impurities of the notified polymer containing polyfluoroalkyl functionality should not exceed the levels attainable utilising international best practice. It is recommended that the levels remain within this range and are further reduced using available technological advances, to the extent practicable.",

Such exposure may increase over time due to the persistence of PFHxA in the environment. A quantitative risk assessment for this exposure was not conducted. However, the available data indicates that PFHxA has a more favourable toxicological profile and bioaccumulation potential than the long chain perfluoroalkyl substances that are the ultimate breakdown products of the long chain perfluoroalkyl polymers currently in Australian commerce (such as PFOA). In particular, it is noted that the polymers being replaced contain perfluoroalkyl carbon chain lengths > 6. It is concluded that the risks to human health from indirect exposure to breakdown products of perfluoroalkyl substances will decrease following introduction of the notified polymer, on the basis that the notified polymer is intended to replace currently available long chain perfluoroalkyl polymers.; The notified polymer is an acrylate-methacrylate copolymer where one of the ester side chains is polyfluorinated.

COMPOSITION The notified polymer contains a polyfluoroalkyl carbon side chain with six perfluorinated carbons.; DEGRADATION PRODUCTS The notified polymer is a potential precursor for PFHxA (perfluorohexanoic acid – CAS name: hexanoic acid, 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,6-undecafluoro-; CAS No. 307-24-4) in the environment.; The notified polymer may undergo slow degradation in the environment. As such, most potential exposure to workers and the public is expected to be to the notified polymer itself, rather than to its degradation products. Exposure to the residual polyfluoroalkyl starting constituents and/or impurities of the notified polymer is also possible. Such exposure is limited by the relatively low concentration of polyfluoroalkyl impurities in the notified polymer in the imported products or in end-use products.; Hazard implication of breakdown products The notified polymer contains polyfluoroalkyl side-chains that that are potential precursors of PFHxA in the environment. PFHxA is a perfluorocarboxylic acid consisting of 5 perfluorinated carbons (a short chain perfluorinated chemical). The notified polymer is proposed to replace polymers that are expected to breakdown to form degradants with perfluorinated carbon chain lengths ranging from 6 to 12. It has been known that the toxicokinetic and toxicological properties of fluorinated substances are generally becoming less favourable with increase of perfluoroalkyl carbon chain length. It has also been reported that the bioaccumulation potential of perfluorocarboxylic acids increases with perfluoroalkyl carbon chain length (Conder, 2008; Giesy 2010).; A review of the literature indicates that PFHxA has a less hazardous human health profile, compared to PFOA (NICNAS, a). It is therefore inferred that the human health hazards associated with the expected breakdown product of the notified polymer (PFHxA) are likely to be similar or less than the human health hazards associated with the expected breakdown products (PFOA and longer chain perfluorocarboxylic acids) of many per- and polyfluoroalkyl chemicals currently on the market and that are intended for replacement by the notified polymer.; Workers may also be exposed to per- and polyfluoroalkyl impurities of the notified polymer at low concentrations (< 0.1%), during reformulation. It is expected that the engineering controls and PPE utilised during these operations (as outlined above) will act to mitigate any risk associated with such exposure.; Risk from exposure to degradants The public may potentially be exposed indirectly to the environmentally persistent, fluorinated degradants of the notified polymer, such as PFHxA. Such exposure may increase over time due to the persistence of PFHxA in the environment. A quantitative risk assessment for this exposure was not conducted. However, the available data indicates that PFHxA has a more favourable toxicological profile and bioaccumulation potential than the long chain perfluoroalkyl substances that are the ultimate breakdown products of the long chain perfluoroalkyl polymers currently in Australian commerce (such as PFOA). In particular, it is noted that the polymers being replaced contain perfluoroalkyl carbon chain lengths > 6. It is concluded that the risks to human health from indirect exposure to breakdown products of perfluoroalkyl substances will decrease following introduction of the notified polymer, on the basis that the notified polymer is intended to replace currently available long chain perfluoroalkyl polymers.; The notified polymer is an acrylate-methacrylate copolymer where one of the ester side chains is polyfluorinated. This polyfluorinated side-chain incorporates a chain segment of six perfluorinated carbon atoms including a terminal perfluoromethyl (CF3) group. Under the NICNAS action plan for assessing and managing chemicals that could degrade to perfluorinated carboxylic acids, the notified polymer would be considered to be an indirect precursor to the exceptionally persistent perfluorinated carboxylic acid, perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) (NICNAS, b).; The biodegradation potential of fluoroacrylate polymers in soils has been investigated and the studies show that analogous polymers have the potential to degrade to release fluorotelomer alcohols (Washington et al, 2009, 2015). The notified polymer is derived from 6:2 fluorotelomer methacrylate and can therefore, potentially, release the 6:2 fluorotelomer alcohol, 6:2 FTOH. This polyfluorinated alcohol is known to undergo environmental biodegradation to form short-chain perfluorocarboxylic acids, including perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) (NICNAS, b).; The notified polymer will eventually degrade in landfill and has the potential to release per- and polyfluoroalkyl degradation products, including short-chain perfluorinated carboxylic acids, such as PFHxA.; PFHxA is expected to be less bioaccumulative than perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and other long-chain perfluoroalkyl acids, supported by the available laboratory (Higgins et al., 2007; Martin et al., 2003a, b; Woodcroft et al., 2010) and field (Falandysz et al., 2006; Falandysz et al., 2007, Furdui et al., 2007) evidence. In general, bioaccumulation potential decreases when the length of the perfluorinated carbon chain is decreased  (Ng and Hungerbühler, 2014, Giesy et al., 2010). The short-chain perfluorocarboxylic acids, including PFHxA, have been assessed to have low bioaccumulation potential based on the currently available information (NICNAS, c, d).; PEC for PFHxA and other perfluorocarboxylic acids The notified polymer has the potential to degrade and ultimately form the persistent degradant, PFHxA. However, the yield and rate of conversion of the notified polymer to PFHxA has not been established.; Analyses of drinking water samples from Europe, Canada, the USA, Japan, India and China have also detected PFHxA and other short chain perfluoroalkyl compounds. PFHxA was recently detected in all samples taken from the Parramatta River (main tributary of Sydney Harbour), with a mean concentration of 2.9 ng/L. Sampling of the Brisbane River catchment following a major flooding event in 2011 also found PFHxA present in water at Somerset Dam, Wivenhoe Dam, Jindalee, Oxley Creek, West End, Bulimba and Moreton Bay. The chemical was detected in all samples obtained at these sites in concentrations ranging between 0.06 and 6.2 ng/L (NICNAS, c).; PFHxA and other poly- and perfluoroalkyl compounds have also been found in landfill leachate, with concentrations of PFHxA ranging from 270 – 790 ng/L (Huset et al., 2011). As landfills are reservoirs of solid waste, and receive waste water treatment plant sludge, which may contain poly- and perfluoroalkyl compounds, landfills have the potential to continue to release PFHxA and homologous perfluorinated carboxylic acids well into the future.; Effects of PFHxA and other perfluorocarboxylic acids  The currently available data, summarised in the NICNAS IMAP Environment Tier II Assessment for Short-Chain Perfluorocarboxylic Acids and their Direct Precursors, indicate that PFHxA and other short-chain perfluorinated acids (i.e. those with five or fewer perfluorinated carbon atoms) have low toxicity to aquatic life (NICNAS, c, d) compared to PFOA and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) (NICNAS, e, f). However, no long-term intergenerational studies were identified for PFHxA and other short chain short-chain PFCAs. Emerging evidence suggest that the most significant aquatic toxicity effects of PFOA and PFOS may manifest in offspring when the parent generation is exposed to PFOA or PFOS (NICNAS, e, f).; However, the notified polymer has the potential to eventually degrade to form very persistent PFHxA. PFHxA is currently understood to have low potential for bioaccumulation (NICNAS, c). The currently available data also indicate that PFHxA and other short-chain perfluorocarboxylic acids and their direct precursors have low toxicity to aquatic life (NICNAS, c, d).; The main environmental risks associated with polyfluoroalkyl polymers relate to the release of perfluorinated degradation products such as PFHxA. It is not possible to quantify the release of PFHxA to the environment from the use of the notified polymer at present. However, as use of chemicals/polymers that degrade to form PFHxA increases, levels of PFHxA may build up in the environment. Hence, there is potential for environmentally significant concentrations to eventually be reached following its accumulation in the environment. In this eventuality, precursors of PFHxA such as the notified polymer cannot be recalled after release and are potential sources of PFHxA releases into the environment even long after their use ceases. Thus, use and disposal of the notified polymer will likely lead to increases in the levels of PFHxA in the environment.; The environmental degradation of the notified polymer is expected to contribute to the cumulative emissions of perfluorohexanoic acid to the environment. Based on the currently available evidence, the concentrations of PFHxA and other short-chain perfluorinated carboxylic acids are not considered to pose a concern for the health of the environment. However, if additional hazard information becomes available to indicate that short-chain perfluorinated carboxylic acids have hazard characteristics of high concern for the environment (such as PBT properties), then the risks posed by industrial uses of precursors to these environmental degradants may need to be re-assessed.; Furdui V, Stock N, Ellis D, Butt C, Whittle D, Crozier P, Reiner E, Muir D and Mabury S (2007) Spatial Distribution of Perfluoroalkyl Contaminants in Lake Trout from the Great Lakes.

The overall human health risk posed by the notified polymer is less than that of the substance it replaces.; However, degradants of the notified polymer, along with associated impurities and residual monomers of the notified polymer, are potential precursors of the very persistent chemical, PFHxA. The assessed use pattern of the notified polymer does not control the release of breakdown products into the environment during use and after disposal and the long-term environmental risk profile of PFHxA is currently unknown. Consequently, the long-term risk profile for the notified polymer and its degradation products is unknown.; The notified polymer is a potential precursor for PFHxA in the environment. PFHxA is an environmentally persistent chemical that has potential to be globally distributed. However, the ecotoxicological profile and bioaccumulation potential of PFHxA is considered to be less problematic when compared with long chain (C8 and above) perfluorocarboxylic acids that PFHxA is expected to replace, noting that current evidence shows that PFHxA was not bioaccumulative in aquatic systems or humans (Russell et al, 2013). Nonetheless, the introduction and use of chemicals that degrade to release PFHxA and other very persistent poly- and perfluoroalkyl compounds should be considered a short-term measure until suitable alternatives, with less persistent chemistry, are identified.; If the notified polymer is released it has the potential to disperse in water but it is not expected to hydrolyse under environmental conditions (pH 4 to 9, 25 C) based on structural considerations. Investigations of the biodegradation potential of fluoroacrylate polymer and fluorotelomer-based urethane polymer in aerobic soils (Russell et al., 2008; Russell et al., 2010; Washington et al., 2009) indicate very limited degradation of the fluorinated polymers. Biodegradation of the backbone of the notified polymer is expected to occur slowly under environmental conditions due to its high molecular weight. Thus, the notified polymer is considered to be persistent in the soil and water compartments.; In surface waters, agricultural soils and landfill, the notified polymer is expected to eventually degrade to form water, oxides of carbon and nitrogen and degradation products containing polyfluoroalkyl functionality. The expected initial polyfluoroalkyl degradation products are assumed to undergo further degradation to form, among other compounds, the very persistent perfluorocarboxylic acid, PFHxA. It is noted that some volatile degradation intermediates have the potential to undergo long range atmospheric transport and thus may result in translocation of PFHxA in the environment. The notified polymer is expected to contain relatively low levels of; PFHxA is expected to be recalcitrant in the environment, and potentially undergo long range transport while mainly staying in the water column. In water, it is expected to be very persistent and will not hydrolyse, photolyse or biodegrade.; PEC for PFHxA and long chain perfluoroalkyl  substances The notified polymer is assumed to degrade and ultimately form the persistent degradant, PFHxA. However, the yield and rate of conversion of the notified polymer to PFHxA has not been established. Environmental monitoring data shows that PFHxA, and PFOA (which PFHxA-chemistry is replacing) is widely found in the environment, particularly in fresh water close to industrial sources, but also in some biota. Water appears to be the main compartment where PFHxA is found. High measured concentrations of both PFHxA and PFOA in surface waters in Germany have been associated with the legal application of waste materials to agricultural soils (Skutlarek et al., 2006) indicating that these chemicals have the potential to enter the aquatic compartment following initial release into the soil compartment.; By reducing the presence of residual poly- and perfluoroalkyl monomers and impurities in polymers, it is expected that indirect releases from the degradation of polyfluoroalkyl substances will become a significant source of persistent poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances in the environment in the future. PFHxA is already being detected in the environment and as the long chain poly- and perfluoroalkyl  substances are phased out in preference for short-chain polyfluoroalkyl chemistry containing a six-carbon perfluorohexyl moiety, the environmental levels of PFHxA are expected to increase.; Perfluoroalkyl substances are expected to be very persistent in the environment (for example, PFOA: t½ (hydrolysis) > 200 years; US EPA, 2002) but PFHxA is considered to have low potential for bioaccumulation. There is limited evidence in the published literature of PFHxA toxicity to aquatic organisms on an acute basis, although it is reported to be toxic to marine algae. There is no available data on the long-term aquatic effects of PFHxA.; However, degradants of the notified polymer, along with associated impurities and residual monomers of the notified polymer, are potential precursors of the persistent chemical, PFHxA. The assessed use pattern of the notified polymer does not control the release of breakdown products into the environment during use and after disposal and the long-term environmental risk profile of PFHxA is currently unknown.

Due to the environmental distribution of PFHxA resulting from the use pattern of the notified polymer, secondary human exposure to PFHxA via the environment may occur. The notified polymer is replacing a long chain polyfluoroalkyl polymer, the latter of which will result in secondary human exposures to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and longer chain perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs). PFOA and longer chain PFCAs are more hazardous to human health and have higher bioaccumulation potential, compared to PFHxA (Russell et al, 2013).

However, the notified polymer may have low absorption based on the presence of perfluoroalkyl functionalities which have both; The notified polymer may undergo slow degradation in the environment. As such, most potential exposure to workers and the public is expected to be to the notified polymer itself, rather than to its degradation products. Exposure to the residual polyfluoroalkyl starting constituents and/or impurities of the notified polymer (discrete polyfluoroalkyl chemicals containing perfluoroalkyl carbon chain lengths ranging from four to ten) is also possible. Such exposure is limited by the low concentration of polyfluoroalkyl impurities in the notified polymer, in the imported products or in end-use products.; Toxicology of breakdown products The notified polymer contains perfluoroalkyl side-chains that are potential precursors of PFHxA in the environment (PFHxA; CAS No. 307-24-4). PFHxA is a perfluorocarboxylic acid consisting of 5 perfluorinated carbons (a short chain perfluorinated chemical). The polymer that is proposed for replacement by the notified polymer is expected to breakdown to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA; CAS No. 335-67-1) (consisting of 7 perfluorinated carbons) and other per- and polyfluorocarboxylic substances with longer perfluoroalkyl carbon chain lengths. The toxicokinetic and toxicological properties of the long chain breakdown products are generally less favourable compared to the short chain breakdown products, with properties becoming less favourable with increasing perfluoroalkyl carbon chain length. In addition, it has been established that the bioaccumulation potential of perfluorocarboxylic acids increases with perfluoroalkyl carbon chain length (Conder, 2008; Giesy 2010).; A review of the literature indicates that PFHxA has a less hazardous human health profile, compared to PFOA (refer to Appendix D for details). It is therefore inferred that the human health hazards associated with the expected breakdown product of the notified polymer (PFHxA) are likely to be similar or less than the human health hazards associated with the expected breakdown products (PFOA and longer chain perfluorocarboxylic acids) of many per- and polyfluoroalkyl chemicals currently on the market and that are intended for replacement by the notified polymer.; Workers may also be exposed to perfluoroalkyl impurities of the notified polymer at relatively low concentrations (< 1 wt%). It is expected that the engineering controls and personal protective equipment utilised during these operations (as outlined above) will act to mitigate any risk associated with such exposure.; Slight eye irritation resulting from ocular exposure to the notified chemical is not expected based on the low concentration in end-use products (up to 3 wt% concentration). Dermal exposure to the notified polymer (up to 3 wt% concentration) is not expected to result in adverse effects, based on the low toxicity of the notified polymer. Additionally, the risk to public health from exposures to perfluoroalkyl impurities during use of products containing the notified polymer (up to 3 wt% concentration) is not considered to be unreasonable based on their low concentration (< 0.1 wt%) in end-use products.; Therefore, the risk to public health from exposures to the notified polymer and perfluoroalkyl impurities during application of stone and tile products is not considered to be unreasonable.; The public may be exposed to the notified polymer and relatively low levels of perfluoroalkyl impurities through dermal contact with treated stone and tile surfaces. This exposure may be on a long term repeated basis. Repeated dose toxicity studies generally indicated low repeated dose toxicity for the notified polymer, additionally the high molecular weight (> 10,000 Da) of the notified polymer is expected to prevent any significant dermal absorption. The risk to public health from repeated dermal contact with the notified polymer is not considered to be unreasonable. Additionally, the risk to public health from exposures to perfluoroalkyl impurities resulting from dermal contact with treated surfaces is not considered to be unreasonable based on their low concentration (< 0.1 wt%) in end-use products.; The public may be exposed indirectly to PFHxA, formed by degradation of the notified polymer in the environment. Such exposure may increase over time due to the persistence of PFHxA in the environment. A quantitative risk assessment for this exposure was not conducted. However, the available data indicates that PFHxA has a more favourable toxicological profile and bioaccumulation potential than the long chain perfluoroalkyl substances that are the ultimate breakdown products of the majority of perfluoroalkyl polymers currently in Australian commerce (such as PFOA). In particular, it is noted that the polymer being replaced contains perfluoroalkyl carbon chain lengths > 6. It is concluded that the risks to human health from indirect exposure to breakdown products of perfluoroalkyl substances will decrease following introduction of the notified polymer, on the basis that the notified polymer is intended to replace a currently available “long” chain perfluoroalkyl polymer.; Some of the notified polymer may be released to sewer during reformulation, use and disposal. In general, cationic polymers have the potential to be removed from influent in sewage treatment plants (STP) via sorption to sludge. However, predictions of the environmental partitioning behaviour of polyfluoroalkyl polymers remain uncertain based on current knowledge because of limited data and their unique properties. In particular, the usual predictive models for partitioning during sewage treatment are inapplicable for chemicals containing perfluoroalkyl functionality as they assume lipophilicity for hydrophobic functionality, whereas the perfluoroalkyl functionality is both hydrophobic and lipophobic. The assumption that cationicity and/or high molecular weight results in efficient removal by sorption to sludge during conventional wastewater treatment has not been verified by supporting data for this class of chemical. Thus, noting the potential for the notified polymer to disperse in water, the notified polymer, and any associated degradation products and/or impurities/residual monomers of poly- or perfluoroalkyl compounds, may remain in the aqueous phase following wastewater treatment. As such, the notified polymer, its degradation products and the poly- or perfluoroalkyl impurities/residual monomers in wastewater have the potential to be released in STP effluent directly to surface waters or reused in the irrigation of agricultural soils throughout Australia.; In surface waters, agricultural soils and landfill, the notified polymer is expected to eventually degrade to form water, oxides of carbon and nitrogen and degradation products containing polyfluoroalkyl functionality. The expected initial polyfluoroalkyl degradation products are assumed to undergo further degradation to form, among other compounds, the very persistent perfluorocarboxylic acid, PFHxA. It is noted that some volatile degradation intermediates have the potential to undergo long range atmospheric transport and thus may result in translocation of PFHxA in the environment. The notified polymer is expected to contain relatively low levels of; impurities that may degrade to form PFOA and other long-chain perfluorocarboxylic acids.; High-temperature incineration is the preferred method of disposal of poly- and perfluoroalkyl compounds due to the environmental persistence characteristics, when it results in mineralisation of the perfluoralkyl functionality to oxides of carbon and hydrofluoric acid. Incomplete combustion of perfluoralkyl functionality may produce an array of partially oxidised fluorocompounds. Therefore, disposal of the notified polymer and its degradation products by incineration should only take place at facilities that demonstrate complete combustion of the perfluoroalkyl functionality and have adequate measures in place to control release of hydrofluoric acid.; Due to its high molecular weight which limits the ability to cross biological membrane, the notified polymer is not expected to bioaccumulate. The available laboratory (Higgins et al., 2007; Martin et al., 2003ab; Woodcroft et al., 2010) and field (Falandysz et al., 2006; Falandysz et al., 2007, Furdui et al., 2007) evidence indicates that PFHxA is expected to be less bioaccumulative than PFOA and other long chain perfluoroalkylated compounds, which short-chain six-fluorinated carbon fluorotelomer chemistry, that may degrade to form PFHxA, is replacing (although PFHxA and PFOA are not considered bioaccumulative in aquatic ecosystems). However, both are bioavailable and have been detected in wildlife as demonstrated by monitoring studies (Kumar et al., 2009; Ye et al., 2008ab; Wang et al., 2008). In general, the available evidence indicates that the bioaccumulation potential of perfluoroalkyl compounds is correlated with increasing carbon chain length (Giesy et al., 2010). Therefore, PFHxA has a lower bioaccumulation potential than PFOA and other long chain perfluoroalkyl substances.; PEC for PFHxA and long chain perfluoroalkyl  substances The notified polymer is assumed to degrade and ultimately form the persistent degradant, PFHxA. However, the yield and rate of conversion of the notified polymer to PFHxA has not been established. Environmental monitoring data shows that PFHxA, and PFOA (which PFHxA-chemistry is replacing) is widely found in the environment, particularly in fresh water close to industrial sources, but also in some biota. Water appears to be the main compartment where PFHxA is found. High measured concentrations of both PFHxA and PFOA in surface waters in Germany have been associated with the legal application of waste materials to agricultural soils (Skutlarek et al., 2006) indicating that these chemicals have the potential to enter the aquatic compartment following initial release into the soil compartment.; PFHxA and other poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances have also been found in landfill leachate, with concentrations of PHFxA ranging from 270 – 790 ng/L (Huset et al., 2011).  As landfills are reservoirs of solid waste, and receive waste water treatment plant sludge, which may contain poly- and perfluoroalkyl  substances, landfills have the potential to continue to release PFHxA and homologues well into the future.; Historically, release of poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances into the environment has been linked to direct releases of low molecular weight poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances, such as poly- and perfluoroalkyl monomers during polymer manufacture and reformulation processes, rather than breakdown of the polymers themselves. In order to limit the extent of direct release of potential PFHxA precursors to the environment, it is recommended that control measures be implemented to minimise the residual weight percentage of unreacted poly- and perfluoroalkyl monomer constituents and impurities in the notified polymer to the extent practicable. Zhao et al. (2013) report that fluorotelomer alcohol (FTOH) residual raw material content in FTOH-based polymeric products is generally less than 0.1%. Efforts have also been made globally to control releases of perfluoroalkyl acids, such as PFOA and potential precursors, by reducing the presence of residual poly- and perfluoroalkyl monomers and impurities in polymers. It is recommended that the total weight of residual monomers and impurities in the notified polymer containing polyfluoroalkyl functionality should not exceed the levels attainable utilising international best practice and the levels are further reduced using available; By reducing the presence of residual poly- and perfluoroalkyl monomers and impurities in polymers, it is expected that indirect releases from the degradation of polyfluoroalkyl substances will become a significant source of persistent poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances in the environment in the future. PFHxA is already being detected in the environment and as the long chain poly- and perfluoroalkyl  substances are phased out in preference for short-chain polyfluoroalkyl chemistry containing a six-carbon perfluorohexyl moiety, the environmental levels of PFHxA are expected to increase.; Half-lives of polyfluoroalkyl polymers in aerobic soil have been found to be indeterminate, with calculated half-lives ranging from decades to millennia (Russell et al., 2008; Russell et al., 2010; Washington et al, 2009). The half-lives of PFHxA in various environmental media are also unknown and its partitioning behaviour is uncertain. Further, degradation products of the notified polymer are unknown based on the information provided by the notifier. Therefore, a PEC for indirect releases of PFHxA arising from proposed use and disposal of the notified polymer in Australia cannot be determined.; Effects of PFHxA and long chain perfluorocarboxylic acids  There are only limited available toxicity data for PFHxA to organisms, and these are limited to aquatic organisms. Based on the available literature, the most sensitive trophic level is algae. Latala et al., (2009) reported the 72-hour median effect concentrations (72 h EC50) for three marine species as follows: 1.0 mg/L for blue green algae (Geitlerinema amphibium); 1.4 mg/L for diatom (Skeletonema marinoi); and, 4.0 mg/L for green algae (Chlorella vulgaris). The data indicates that PFHxA is toxic to algae on an acute basis. The study also investigated the toxicity of PFOA to the three marine species: 0.25 mg/L for blue green algae; 0.37 mg/L for diatom; and, 0.98 mg/L for green algae. The data indicates that PFOA is very toxic to algae on an acute; Giesy et al. (2010) reported the relationship between increasing carbon chain length and increasing toxicity. Therefore, PFHxA is expected to have a less problematic ecotoxicological profile than PFOA and other long chain perfluorocarboxylic acids it is expected to replace. Long-term effects data that reflect or model the periods over which perfluorocarboxylic acids are present in the environment are not available for PFHxA or long chain perfluorocarboxylic acids. Therefore, the long-term hazard to aquatic organisms has not been adequately established and is unknown.; Perfluoroalkyl substances are expected to be very persistent in the environment (for example, PFOA: t½ (hydrolysis) > 200 years; US EPA, 2002) but PFHxA is considered to have low potential for bioaccumulation. There is limited evidence in the published literature of PFHxA toxicity to aquatic organisms on an acute basis, although it is reported to be toxic to marine algae. There is no available data on the long-term aquatic effects of PFHxA.; The main environmental risks associated with polyfluoroalkyl polymers relate to the release of perfluoroalkyl degradation products such as PFHxA. However, it is not possible to quantify the long-term risks of PFHxA to the environment due to knowledge gaps both in predicting environmental concentrations from indirect sources of release and its long-term environmental effects. To date, the available data on environmental concentrations of PFHxA indicate a low risk of environmental toxicity. However, the long-term environmental risk profile of PFHxA is currently unknown, and further long term research should ideally be undertaken to characterise this risk.; after their use ceases. Thus, use and disposal of the notified polymer increases the environmental risk profile of PFHxA. The notified polymer also contains impurities which are assumed to degrade to form PFHxA and longer chain perfluorocarboxylic acids. Therefore, considering the dispersive use pattern of the notified polymer, it is recommended to reduce the impurities in the notified polymer that breakdown to form PFHxA and longer chain perfluorocarboxylic acids, to the extent possible.; However, degradants of the notified polymer, along with associated impurities and residual monomers of the notified polymer, are potential precursors of the persistent chemical, PFHxA. The assessed use pattern of the notified polymer does not control the release of breakdown products into the environment during use and after disposal and the long-term environmental risk profile of PFHxA is currently unknown. Consequently, the long-term risk profile of the notified polymer and its degradation products is unknown. This situation may change if further data on the environmental behaviour of the notified polymer and its poly- and perfluoroalkylated degradation products (including PFHxA) were to become available.; The notified polymer is a potential precursor for PFHxA in the environment, PFHxA is an environmentally persistent chemical that has potential to be globally distributed. However, the ecotoxicological profile and bioaccumulation potential of PFHxA is considered to be less problematic when compared with long chain (C8 and above) perfluoroalkyl acids that PFHxA is expected to replace. Nonetheless, the introduction and use of chemicals that degrade to release PFHxA and other very persistent poly- and perfluoroalkyl compounds should be considered a short-term measure until suitable alternatives, with less persistent chemistry, are identified.; In order to limit the extent of direct release of potential PFHxA and long chain perfluorocarboxylic acid precursors to the environment, it is recommended that control measures be implemented to minimise the residual weight percentage of unreacted polyfluoroalkyl monomer constituents and impurities in the notified polymer to the extent practicable. Where possible, the total weight of residual monomers and impurities in the notified polymer containing polyfluoroalkyl functionality should not exceed the levels attainable utilising international best practice. It is recommended that the levels remain within this range and are further reduced using available technological advances, to the extent practicable.; APPENDIX D: TOXICOLOGY OF PERFLUOROHEXANOIC ACID (PFHXA); AGC Chemicals (2010) A 24-month Oral (Gavage) Combined Chronic Toxicity/Carcinogenicity Study of Perfluorohexanoic Acid (PFHxA) in Rats (Study no.

LTD1667," in inks Exposure of workers to the notified polymer (up to 1% concentration) during the use of ink products containing it is expected to be low due to the enclosed automated nature of the processes.  Workers required to intervene in the process may undergo dermal, ocular and inhalation exposure.  Service technicians are expected to wear disposable gloves.  Systemic exposures may result from dermal contact with substrates to which ink containing the notified polymer has been applied, however, based on the relatively low concentration in the end-use products and the fact that the majority of the polymer will remain bound to the substrate to which it was applied, exposure is expected to be low.","However, the notified polymer is a potential precursor of perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA), which is persistent in the environment. Due to the environmental distribution of PFHxA resulting from the use pattern of the notified polymer, secondary human exposure to PFHxA via the environment may occur. The notified polymer is replacing a long chain polyfluoroalkyl polymer, the latter of which will result in secondary human exposures to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and longer chain perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs). PFOA and longer chain PFCAs are more hazardous to human health and have higher bioaccumulation potential, compared to PFHxA (Russell et al, 2013). The overall human health risk posed by the notified polymer is less than that of the substance it replaces.; However, degradants of the notified polymer, along with associated impurities and residual monomers of the notified polymer, are potential precursors of the very persistent chemical, PFHxA. The assessed use pattern of; The notified polymer is a potential precursor for PFHxA in the environment. PFHxA is an environmentally persistent chemical that has potential to be globally distributed. However, the ecotoxicological profile and bioaccumulation potential of PFHxA is considered to be less problematic when compared with long chain (C8 and above) perfluorocarboxylic acids that PFHxA is expected to replace, noting that current evidence shows that PFHxA was not bioaccumulative in aquatic systems or humans (Russell et al, 2013). Nonetheless, the introduction and use of chemicals that degrade to release PFHxA and other very persistent poly- and perfluoroalkyl compounds should be considered a short-term measure until suitable alternatives, with less persistent chemistry, are identified.; Over time, the notified polymer is expected to become dissociated from the printed articles. The notified polymer has the potential to disperse in water but it is not expected to hydrolyse under environmental conditions (pH 4 to 9, 25 ºC) based on structural considerations. A test study indicates that the notified polymer is rapidly degradable, achieving 62% degradation in 28 days but failing the 10-day window criteria. Degradation products are not known for certain as no characterisation of the degradation products was undertaken in the biodegradation test. A recent paper found that close analogues of the notified polymer undergo rapid biotransformation via a chain shortening mechanism (see Exempt Information). However, the notified polymer is not expected to completely mineralise and degradation products may include more stable lower molecular weight polymers with per- and polyfluoroalkyl functionality or the very persistent perfluorinated degradation product PFHxA. Therefore, the notified polymer has the potential to release the PFHxA after only a short period of time.; In surface waters, agricultural soils and landfill, the notified polymer is expected to eventually degrade to form water, oxides of carbon and nitrogen and degradation products containing per- and polyfluoroalky functionality. The expected initial per- and polyfluoroalkyl degradation products are assumed to undergo further degradation to form, among other compounds, the very persistent perfluorinated degradation product, PFHxA.

The notified polymer also contains impurities that may degrade to form perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and other long-chain per- and polyfluorocarboxylic acids.; PFHxA is expected to be recalcitrant in the environment, and potentially undergo long range transport while mainly staying in the water column. In water, it is expected to be very persistent and will not hydrolyse, photolyse or biodegrade.; PEC for PFHxA and long chain perfluoroalkyl substances The notified polymer is assumed to degrade and ultimately form the persistent degradant, PFHxA. However, the yield and rate of conversion of the notified polymer to PFHxA has not been established as characterisation of the degradation products was not undertaken in the biodegradation study. Environmental monitoring data shows that PFHxA, and PFOA which PFHxA-chemistry is replacing, is widely found in the environment, particularly in fresh water close to industrial sources, but also in some biota.

Such levels should be as low as practicable: where possible, the total weight of these constituents should not exceed the levels attainable utilising international best practice.; − additional information has become available to the person as to an adverse effect of the poly- or perfluoroalkyl degradation products of the notified polymer (such as PFHxA);; − additional information has become available to the person as to the environmental fate of the polymer or its poly- or perfluoroalkyl degradation products (such as PFHxA) in relation to degradation or partitioning behaviour, including during water treatment processes;; Over time, the notified polymer is expected to ultimately degrade into perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) - CAS name: Hexanoic acid, 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,6-undecafluoro-; CAS No. 307-24-4.; The notified polymer is not expected to undergo significant degradation during use. As such, most potential exposure to workers and the public is expected to be to the notified polymer itself, rather than to its degradation products. Exposure to the residual polyfluoroalkyl starting constituents and/or impurities of the notified polymer (discrete polyfluoroalkyl chemicals containing perfluoroalkyl carbon chain lengths ranging from four to ten) is also possible. Such exposure is limited by the relatively low concentration of polyfluoroalkyl impurities in the notified polymer (up to 1%) and in the imported printer cartridges or printheads (up to 0.01%).; Inhalation toxicity Perfluoroalkyl chemicals have been known to cause acute lung injury. Acute lung injury is characterised by respiratory problems ranging from mild to severe effects, including mortality, associated with acute or repeated exposures. Acute lung injury is generally considered to be of most concern when the compound has surface activity (Fischer et al., 2012).; Toxicology of break down products The notified polymer contains perfluoroalkyl side-chains that are potential precursors of PFHxA in the environment (PFHxA; CAS No. 307-24-4), a perfluorinated chemical consisting of 5 perfluorinated carbons (a short chain perfluorinated chemical). The polymer that is proposed for replacement by the notified polymer is expected to break down to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA; CAS No. 335-67-1) (consisting of 7 perfluorinated carbons) and other per- and polyfluorocarboxylic substances with longer perfluoroalkyl carbon chain lengths. The toxicokinetic and toxicological properties of the long chain break down products are generally less favourable compared to the short chain break down products, with properties becoming less favourable with increasing perfluoroalkyl carbon chain length. In addition, it has been established that the bioaccumulation potential of perfluorocarboxylic acids increases with perfluoroalkyl carbon chain length (Conder, 2008; Giesy 2010).; A review of the literature indicates that PFHxA has a less hazardous human health profile, compared to PFOA (refer to Appendix D for details). It is therefore inferred that the human health hazards associated with the expected break down product of the notified polymer (PFHxA) are likely to be similar or less than the human health hazards associated with the expected break down products (PFOA and longer chain perfluorocarboxylic acids) of many per- and polyfluoroalkyl chemicals currently on the market and that are intended for replacement by the notified polymer.; Workers may also be exposed to per- and polyfluoroalkyl impurities of the notified polymer at relatively low concentrations (< 0.01%). It is expected that the engineering controls and personal protective equipment utilised during these operations (as outlined above) will act to mitigate any risk associated with such exposure.; The public may also be exposed to the notified polymer and low levels of per- and polyfluoroalkyl impurities from direct dermal contact with articles that have been printed with inks containing the notified polymer.  This exposure may be on a long term repeated basis. However, dermal transfer from the treated article is expected to be low as the notified polymer will be present at low concentrations and will predominantly remain absorbed to the substrate to which it was applied.  Thus the risk to public health from repeated dermal exposure to the notified polymer from treated articles is not considered to be unreasonable. The risk to public health from long term repeated dermal exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl impurities of the notified polymer from treated articles may be mitigated by the relatively low concentrations at which they are present in end use; boundaries. Predictions of the environmental partitioning behaviour of polyfluoroalkyl surfactants such as the notified polymer remain uncertain based on current knowledge because of limited data and their unique properties. In particular, the usual predictive models for partitioning during sewage treatment are inapplicable for chemicals containing perfluorinated functionality as they assume lipophilicity for hydrophobic functionality, whereas the perfluorinated functionality is both hydrophobic and lipophobic. The assumption that surface activity and/or high molecular weight results in efficient removal by sorption to sludge during conventional wastewater treatment has not been verified by supporting data for this class of chemical. Thus, noting its potential to disperse in water, a significant proportion of the notified polymer, and any associated impurities/residual monomers of poly- and perfluoroalkyl compounds, may well remain in the aqueous phase following wastewater treatment. As such, the notified polymer and the poly- and perfluoroalkyl impurities/residual monomers in wastewater have the potential to be released in STP effluent directly to surface waters or reused in the irrigation of agricultural soils throughout Australia.; Over time, the notified polymer is expected to become dissociated from the printed articles. The notified polymer has the potential to disperse in water but it is not expected to hydrolyse under environmental conditions (pH 4 to 9, 25 ºC) based on structural considerations. A test study indicates that the notified polymer is rapidly degradable, achieving 62% degradation in 28 days but failing the 10-day window criteria. Degradation products are not known for certain as no characterisation of the degradation products was undertaken in the biodegradation test. A recent paper found that close analogues of the notified polymer undergo rapid biotransformation via a chain shortening mechanism (see Exempt Information). However, the notified polymer is not expected to completely mineralise and degradation products may include more stable lower molecular weight polymers with per- and polyfluoroalkyl functionality or the very persistent perfluorinated degradation product PFHxA. Therefore, the notified polymer has the potential to release the PFHxA after only a short period of time.; In surface waters, agricultural soils and landfill, the notified polymer is expected to eventually degrade to form water, oxides of carbon and nitrogen and degradation products containing per- and polyfluoroalky functionality. The expected initial per- and polyfluoroalkyl degradation products are assumed to undergo further degradation to form, among other compounds, the very persistent perfluorinated degradation product, PFHxA. It is noted that some volatile degradation intermediates have the potential to undergo long range atmospheric transport and thus may result in translocation of PFHxA in the environment. The notified polymer also contains impurities that may degrade to form perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and other long-chain per- and polyfluorocarboxylic acids.; High-temperature incineration is the preferred method of disposal of poly- and perfluoroalkyl compounds due to the environmental persistence characteristics, when it results in mineralisation of the perfluoralkyl functionality to oxides of carbon and hydrofluoric acid. Incomplete combustion of perfluoralkyl functionality may produce an array of partially oxidised fluorocompounds such as perfluoroacetic acid, fluorinated dioxins and furans. Therefore, disposal of the notified polymer and its degradation products by incineration should only take place at facilities that demonstrate complete combustion of the perfluoroalkyl functionality and have adequate measures in place to control release of hydrofluoric acid.; The notified polymer has the potential to bioaccumulate based on its molecular weight and n-octanol/water partition coefficient. Generally, a log Pow of > 4.2 indicates a potential for bioaccumulation as high values indicate a tendency to partition to lipids while a low value indicates a tendency to partition to water. However, this also assumes lipophilicity of the hydrophobic functionality which does not apply to perfluoroalkyl functionality. Certain perfluoroalkyl compounds are known to accumulate in the blood and liver rather than lipids in biological systems (Danish EPA, 2008). As perfluoroalkyl compounds do not follow the usual mechanism for bioaccumulation and are not expected to bioaccumulate in lipids, and because of the notified polymer’s surface-active properties, the n-octanol-water partition coefficient is not considered to be a reliable indicator of bioaccumulation potential for the notified polymer. Further, the notified polymer has the potential to undergo degradation and biotransformation in the environment, reducing its potential to bioaccumulate.; The available laboratory (Higgins et al., 2007; Martin et al., 2003ab; Woodcroft et al., 2010) and field (Falandysz et al., 2006; Falandysz et al., 2007, Furdui et al., 2007) evidence indicates that PFHxA is expected to be less bioaccumulative than PFOA and other long chain perfluoroalkyl compounds, which PFHxA-; PEC for PFHxA and long chain perfluoroalkyl substances The notified polymer is assumed to degrade and ultimately form the persistent degradant, PFHxA. However, the yield and rate of conversion of the notified polymer to PFHxA has not been established as characterisation of the degradation products was not undertaken in the biodegradation study. Environmental monitoring data shows that PFHxA, and PFOA which PFHxA-chemistry is replacing, is widely found in the environment, particularly in fresh water close to industrial sources, but also in some biota. Water appears to be the main compartment where PFHxA is found. High measured concentrations of both PFHxA and PFOA in surface waters in Germany have been associated with the legal application of waste materials to agricultural soils (Skutlarek et al., 2006) indicating that these chemicals have the potential to enter the aquatic compartment following initial release into the soil compartment.; PFHxA and other poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances have also been found in landfill leachate, with concentrations of PFHxA ranging from 270 – 790 ng/L (Huset et al., 2011).  As landfills are reservoirs of solid; waste, and receive waste water treatment plant sludge, which may contain poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances, landfills have the potential to continue to release PFHxA and homologues well into the future.; Historically, release of poly and perfluoroalkyl substances into the environment has been linked to direct releases of low molecular weight poly- and perfluoroalkyl compounds, such as poly- and perfluoroalkyl monomers during polymer manufacture and reformulation processes, rather than breakdown of the polymers themselves. In order to limit the extent of direct release of potential PFHxA precursors to the environment, it is recommended that control measures be implemented to minimise the residual weight percentage of unreacted poly- and perfluoroalkyl monomer constituents and impurities in the notified polymer to the extent practicable. Zhao et al. (2013) report that fluorotelomer alcohol (FTOH) residual raw material content in FTOH-based polymeric products is generally less than 0.1%. Efforts have also been made globally to control releases of perfluoroalkyl acids, such as PFOA and potential precursors, by reducing the presence of residual poly- and perfluoroalkyl monomers and impurities in polymers. It is recommended that the total weight of residual monomers and impurities in the notified polymer containing polyfluoroalkyl functionality should not exceed the levels attainable utilising international best practice and the levels are further reduced using available technological advances, to the extent practicable.; By reducing the presence of residual poly- and perfluoroalkyl monomers and impurities in polymers, it is expected that indirect releases from the degradation of polyfluoroalkyl substances will become a significant source of persistent poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances in the environment in the future. PFHxA is already being detected in the environment and as the long chain poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances are phased out in preference for short-chain polyfluoroalkyl chemistry containing a six-carbon perfluorohexyl moiety, the environmental levels of PFHxA are expected to increase.; Half-lives of polyfluoroalkyl polymers in aerobic soil have so far been found to be indeterminate (Russell et al., 2008; Russell et al., 2010; Washington et al, 2009). The half-lives of PFHxA in various environmental media are also unknown and its partitioning behaviour is uncertain. Further, degradation products of the notified polymer are unknown as characterisation was not undertaken in the biodegradation study. Therefore, a PEC for indirect releases of PFHxA arising from proposed use and disposal of the notified polymer in Australia cannot be determined.; Effects of PFHxA and long chain perfluorocarboxylic acids  There are only limited available toxicity data for PFHxA to organisms, and these are limited to aquatic organisms. Based on the available literature, the most sensitive trophic level is algae. Latala et al., (2009) reported the 72-hour median effect concentrations (72 h EC50) for three marine species as follows: 1.0 mg/L for blue green algae (Geitlerinema amphibium); 1.4 mg/L for diatom (Skeletonema marinoi); and, 4.0 mg/L for green algae (Chlorella vulgaris). The data indicates that PFHxA is toxic to algae on an acute basis. The study; Giesy et al. (2010) reported the relationship between increasing carbon chain length and increasing toxicity. Therefore, PFHxA is expected to have a less problematic ecotoxicological profile than PFOA and other long chain perfluorocarboxylic acids it is expected to replace. Long-term effects data that reflect or model the periods over which perfluorocarboxylic acids are present in the environment are not available for PFHxA or long chain perfluorocarboxylic acids. Therefore, the long-term hazard to aquatic organisms has not been adequately established and is unknown.; Perfluoroalkyl substances are expected to be very persistent in the environment (for example, PFOA: t½ (hydrolysis) > 200 years; US EPA 2002) but PFHxA is considered to have low potential for bioaccumulation. There is limited evidence in the published literature of PFHxA toxicity to aquatic organisms on an acute basis, although it is reported to be toxic to marine algae. There is no available data on the long-term aquatic effects of PFHxA.; The main environmental risks associated with polyfluoroalkyl polymers relate to the release of perfluoroalkyl degradation products such as PFHxA. However, it is not possible to quantify the long-term risks of PFHxA to the environment due to knowledge gaps both in predicting environmental concentrations from indirect sources of release and its long-term environmental effects. . To date, the available data on environmental concentrations of PFHxA indicate a low risk of environmental toxicity. However, the long-term environmental risk profile of PFHxA is currently unknown, and further long term research should ideally be undertaken to characterise this risk.; However, degradants of the notified polymer, along with associated impurities and residual monomers of the notified polymer, are potential precursors of the very persistent chemical, PFHxA. The assessed use pattern of the notified polymer does not control the release of breakdown products into the environment during use and after disposal and the long-term environmental risk profile of PFHxA is currently unknown. Consequently, the long-term risk profile of the notified polymer and its degradation products is unknown. This situation may change if further data on the environmental behaviour of the notified polymer and its poly- and perfluoroalkylated degradation products (including PFHxA) were to become available.; The notified polymer is a potential precursor for PFHxA in the environment, PFHxA, is environmentally persistent and has potential to be globally distributed. However, the ecotoxicological profile and bioaccumulation potential of PFHxA is considered to be less problematic when compared with long chain (C8 and above) perfluoroalkyl acids that PFHxA is expected to replace. Nonetheless, it is recommended that the introduction and use of chemicals that degrade to release PFHxA and other very persistent poly- and perfluoroalkyl compounds should be considered a short-term measure until suitable alternatives, with less persistent chemistry, are identified.; In order to limit the extent of direct release of potential PFHxA and long chain perfluorocarboxylic acid precursors to the environment, it is recommended that control measures be implemented to minimise the residual weight percentage of unreacted polyfluoroalkyl monomer constituents and impurities in the notified polymer to the extent practicable. Where possible, the total weight of residual monomers and impurities in the notified polymer containing polyfluoroalkyl functionality should not exceed the levels attainable utilising international best practice. It is recommended that the levels remain within this range and are further reduced using available technological advances, to the extent practicable.; APPENDIX D: TOXICOLOGY OF PERFLUOROHEXANOIC ACID (PFHXA); AGC Chemicals (2010) A 24-month Oral (Gavage) Combined Chronic Toxicity/Carcinogenicity Study of Perfluorohexanoic Acid (PFHxA) in Rats (Study no.

LTD1902, The notified polymer will be imported as a component of tinters at < 0.1% concentration for automotive paints. Selemix Tinters containing the notified polymer will be used at up to 50% concentration in the final paints; therefore the maximum final use concentration of the notified polymer in the paints will be < 0.05%.,"However, the notified polymer is anticipated to degrade in the environment to release fluorinated degradants similar to perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) that is known to be persistent. Due to environmental distribution of the persistent chemicals, the use of the notified polymer may lead to secondary human exposure to the fluorinated degradants via the environment. The notified polymer is proposed to replace perfluoroalkyl polymers that may release longer chain perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) in the environment. Longer chain PFCAs are known to be more hazardous to human health with higher bioaccumulation potential compared to shorter chain PFCAs. The overall human health risk posed by the notified polymer is anticipated to be less than that of the perfluoroalkyl polymers it replaces.; However, the anticipated degradants of the notified polymer are chemically similar to the very persistent chemical, PFHxA. The assessed use pattern of the notified polymer does not control the release of breakdown products into the environment during use and after disposal and the long-term environmental risk profile of PFHxA is currently unknown. Consequently, the long-term risk profile for the notified polymer and its degradation products is unknown.; No environmental fate data or degradation studies were provided by the notifier. The persistence of chemicals similar to PFHxA in the environment is of concern because they have potential to be globally distributed. However, the ecotoxicological profile and bioaccumulation potential of PFHxA is considered to be less problematic when compared with long chain (C8 and above) perfluorocarboxylic acids, noting that current evidence suggests PFHxA is not bioaccumulative in aquatic ecosystems. Nonetheless, the introduction and use of chemicals that release very persistent fluorinated degradants upon degradation should be considered a short-term measure until suitable alternatives, with less persistent chemistry, are identified.; DEGRADATION PRODUCTS The notified polymer may potentially degrade to form 1-heptanol, 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7-dodecafluoro- (dodecafluoroheptanol, CAS No. 335-99-9) or heptanoic acid, 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7-dodecafluoro- (dodecafluroheptylic acid, CAS No. 1546-95-8) that are similar to hexanoic acid, 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,6-undecafluoro- (PFHxA, CAS No. 307-24-4) and may be persistent in the environment.; The notified polymer is a potential precursor for dodecafluoroheptanol and dodecafluroheptylic acid that are similar to PFHxA and may be persistent in the environment. This may lead to secondary human exposure to PFHxA-like chemicals. This exposure is unquantifiable.; Risk from exposure to degradants The public may potentially be exposed indirectly to the environmentally persistent, fluorinated degradants of the notified polymer, such as dodecafluoroheptanol and dodecafluroheptylic acid, chemically similar to PFHxA. The long term significance and magnitude of such exposure remain unknown. However, available data indicates that PFHxA has reduced toxicological properties and bioaccumulation potential compared to the long chain perfluoroalkyl substances such as PFOA that are known breakdown products of perfluoroalkyl polymers currently in Australian commerce. The notified polymer is proposed to replace polymers containing perfluoroalkyl carbon chain lengths ranging from 6 to 12. Based on the proposed replacement, it is anticipated that the risk to human health from indirect exposure to breakdown products of overall perfluoroalkyl substances would decrease following the introduction of the notified polymer.; No environmental fate data were submitted. The majority of the notified polymer is expected to be bound within an inert matrix of cured paints as part of its use pattern as a component in automotive paints. The majority of notified polymer in wastes disposed of to landfill is expected to be in solid cured paint and it is not expected to be bioavailable, biodegradable nor mobile in this form. Based on the high molecular weight of the notified polymer, it is not likely to cross biological membranes, hence bioaccumulation is not expected. Furthermore, bioaccumulation of the notified polymer is unlikely due to limited bioavailability in its solid form in landfill and its limited release to surface waters during use. The notified polymer will eventually degrade in landfill or by thermal decomposition during metal reclamation processes, to form water and oxides of carbon and degradation products containing polyfluoroalkyl functionality. The expected initial polyfluoroalkyl degradation products are assumed to undergo further degradation to form substances similar to 6:2 fluorotelomer alcohols (FTOH) and PFHxA among other compounds. It is noted that some volatile degradation intermediates have the potential to undergo long range atmospheric transport and thus may result in translocation of persistent substances in the environment.; Chemicals similar to PFHxA are expected to be recalcitrant in the environment, and potentially undergo long range transport while mainly staying in the water column. In water, they are expected to be very persistent and will not undergo hydrolysis photolysis or biodegradation.; The long-chain perfluorinated acid, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and its ammonium salt, have been categorised as persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT) substances according to domestic environmental hazard criteria. Chemicals with these hazard characteristics are of high concern to the environment and PFOA (and substances which may degrade to PFOA) are subject to increasingly stringent regulatory controls in other developed countries. However, the short-chain perfluorocarbons have been assessed as being of lower overall concern to the environment based on the available information (NICNAS, 2015b).; Conclusions On the basis of the assumed low hazard and assessed use pattern, the notified polymer is not considered to pose an unreasonable short-term risk to the environment. However, when the notified polymer is disposed of to landfill, it is expected to very slowly degrade and, potentially, form the persistent chemicals similar to perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA). The assessed use pattern of the notified polymer does not control the release of breakdown products into the environment after disposal and the long-term environmental risk profile of PFHxA is currently unknown. Consequently, the long-term risk profile for the notified polymer and its degradation products is unknown.; Conder JM, Hoke RA, De Wolf W, Russell MH and Buck RC (2008) Are PFCAs Bioaccumulative?

Exposure to the residual polyfluoroalkyl starting constituents and/or impurities of the notified polymer is also possible. Such exposure is limited by the low concentration of polyfluoroalkyl impurities in the notified polymer in the imported products and end-use products.; Hazard implication of breakdown products The notified polymer contains polyfluoroalkyl side-chains that may potentially degrade to form degradants with a polyfluorinated carbon chain length of 6. The notified polymer is proposed to replace polymers that are expected to breakdown to form degradants with perfluorinated carbon chain lengths ranging from 6 to 12. It has been known that the toxicokinetic and toxicological properties of fluorinated substances are generally becoming less favourable with increase of perfluoroalkyl carbon chain length. It has also been reported that the bioaccumulation potential of perfluorocarboxylic acids increases with perfluoroalkyl carbon chain length (Conder, 2008; Giesy 2010).; The notified polymer may potentially breakdown to form polyfluorinated degradants chemically similar to PFHxA. PFHxA is known to have a less hazardous human health profile compared to PFOA (NICNAS, 2015a). It is therefore inferred that the human health hazards associated with the expected breakdown products of the notified polymer are likely to be similar or less than those associated with PFOA or longer chain perfluorocarboxylic acids, which are known degradants of many perfluoroalkyl polymers currently on the market.; Workers may also be exposed to per- and polyfluoroalkyl impurities of the notified polymer at low concentrations (< 0.1%), during reformulation. It is expected that the engineering controls and PPE utilised during these operations (as outlined above) will act to mitigate any risk associated with such exposure.; Risk from exposure to degradants The public may potentially be exposed indirectly to the environmentally persistent, fluorinated degradants of the notified polymer, such as dodecafluoroheptanol and dodecafluroheptylic acid, chemically similar to PFHxA. The long term significance and magnitude of such exposure remain unknown. However, available data indicates that PFHxA has reduced toxicological properties and bioaccumulation potential compared to the long chain perfluoroalkyl substances such as PFOA that are known breakdown products of perfluoroalkyl polymers currently in Australian commerce. The notified polymer is proposed to replace polymers containing perfluoroalkyl carbon chain lengths ranging from 6 to 12. Based on the proposed replacement, it is anticipated that the risk to human health from indirect exposure to breakdown products of overall perfluoroalkyl substances would decrease following the introduction of the notified polymer.; No environmental fate data were submitted. The majority of the notified polymer is expected to be bound within an inert matrix of cured paints as part of its use pattern as a component in automotive paints. The majority of notified polymer in wastes disposed of to landfill is expected to be in solid cured paint and it is not expected to be bioavailable, biodegradable nor mobile in this form. Based on the high molecular weight of the notified polymer, it is not likely to cross biological membranes, hence bioaccumulation is not expected. Furthermore, bioaccumulation of the notified polymer is unlikely due to limited bioavailability in its solid form in landfill and its limited release to surface waters during use. The notified polymer will eventually degrade in landfill or by thermal decomposition during metal reclamation processes, to form water and oxides of carbon and degradation products containing polyfluoroalkyl functionality. The expected initial polyfluoroalkyl degradation products are assumed to undergo further degradation to form substances similar to 6:2 fluorotelomer alcohols (FTOH) and PFHxA among other compounds. It is noted that some volatile degradation intermediates have the potential to undergo long range atmospheric transport and thus may result in translocation of persistent substances in the environment.; High-temperature incineration is the preferred method of disposal of poly- and perfluoroalkyl chemicals (and polymers) due to the environmental persistence characteristics, when it results in mineralisation of the perfluoroalkyl functionality to oxides of carbon and hydrofluoric acid. Incomplete combustion of perfluoroalkyl functionality may produce an array of partially oxidised fluorocompounds. Therefore, disposal of the notified polymer and its degradation products by incineration should only take place at facilities that demonstrate complete combustion of the perfluoroalkyl functionality and have adequate measures in place to control release of hydrofluoric acid.; The long-chain perfluorinated acid, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and its ammonium salt, have been categorised as persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT) substances according to domestic environmental hazard criteria. Chemicals with these hazard characteristics are of high concern to the environment and PFOA (and substances which may degrade to PFOA) are subject to increasingly stringent regulatory controls in other developed countries. However, the short-chain perfluorocarbons have been assessed as being of lower overall concern to the environment based on the available information (NICNAS, 2015b).; With reference to degradants, the currently available data for the short-chain perfluorocarbons are summarised in the IMAP Environment Tier II assessment for Short-Chain Perfluorocarboxylic acids and their direct precursors. Based on data for PFHxA and perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA), all short-chain perfluorocarboxylic acids, including perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA), were categorised as not Toxic (Not T) according to domestic environmental hazard criteria (NICNAS, 2015b).; Conclusions On the basis of the assumed low hazard and assessed use pattern, the notified polymer is not considered to pose an unreasonable short-term risk to the environment. However, when the notified polymer is disposed of to landfill, it is expected to very slowly degrade and, potentially, form the persistent chemicals similar to perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA). The assessed use pattern of the notified polymer does not control the release of breakdown products into the environment after disposal and the long-term environmental risk profile of PFHxA is currently unknown. Consequently, the long-term risk profile for the notified polymer and its degradation products is unknown.; National Industrial Chemicals Notification and Assessment Scheme (NICNAS, 2015a).

Due to the environmental distribution of PFHxA resulting from the use pattern of the notified polymer, secondary human exposure to PFHxA via the environment may occur. The notified polymer is replacing a long chain polyfluoroalkyl polymer, the latter of which will result in secondary human exposures to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and longer chain perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs). PFOA and longer chain PFCAs are more hazardous to human health and have higher bioaccumulation potential, compared to PFHxA (Russell et al, 2013). The overall human health risk posed by the notified polymer is less than that of the substance it replaces.; However, degradants of the notified polymer, along with associated impurities and residual monomers of the notified polymer, are potential precursors of the very persistent chemical, PFHxA. The assessed use pattern of the notified polymer does not control the release of breakdown products into the environment during use and after disposal and the long-term environmental risk profile of PFHxA is currently unknown. Consequently, the long-term risk profile for the notified polymer and its degradation products is unknown. This situation may change if further data on the environmental behaviour of the notified polymer and its poly- and perfluoroalkyl degradation products (including PFHxA) were to become available.; The notified polymer is a potential precursor for PFHxA in the environment. PFHxA is an environmentally persistent chemical that has potential to be globally distributed. However, the ecotoxicological profile and bioaccumulation potential of PFHxA is considered to be less problematic when compared with long chain (C8 and above) perfluorocarboxylic acids that PFHxA is expected to replace, noting that current evidence shows that PFHxA was not bioaccumulative in aquatic systems or humans (Russell et al, 2013). Nonetheless, the introduction and use of chemicals that degrade to release PFHxA and other very persistent poly- and perfluoroalkyl compounds should be considered a short-term measure until suitable alternatives, with less persistent chemistry, are identified.; the potential to disperse in water but it is not expected to hydrolyse under environmental conditions (pH 4 to 9, 25 ºC) based on structural considerations. A test study indicates that the notified polymer is rapidly degradable, achieving 62% degradation in 28 days but failing the 10-day window criteria. Degradation products are not known for certain as no characterisation of the degradation products was undertaken in the biodegradation test. A recent paper found that close analogues of the notified polymer undergo rapid biotransformation via a chain shortening mechanism (see Exempt Information). However, the notified polymer is not expected to completely mineralise and degradation products may include more stable lower molecular weight polymers with per- and polyfluoroalkyl functionality or the very persistent perfluorinated degradation product PFHxA. Therefore, the notified polymer has the potential to release the PFHxA after only a short period of time.; In surface waters, agricultural soils and landfill, the notified polymer is expected to eventually degrade to form water, oxides of carbon and nitrogen and degradation products containing per- and polyfluoroalky functionality. The expected initial per- and polyfluoroalkyl degradation products are assumed to undergo further degradation to form, among other compounds, the very persistent perfluorinated degradation product, PFHxA. It is noted that some volatile degradation intermediates have the potential to undergo long range atmospheric transport and thus may result in translocation of PFHxA in the environment. The notified polymer also contains impurities that may degrade to form perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and other long-chain per- and polyfluorocarboxylic acids.; PFHxA is expected to be recalcitrant in the environment, and potentially undergo long range transport while mainly staying in the water column. In water, it is expected to be very persistent and will not hydrolyse, photolyse or biodegrade.; PEC for PFHxA and long chain perfluoroalkyl substances The notified polymer is assumed to degrade and ultimately form the persistent degradant, PFHxA. However, the yield and rate of conversion of the notified polymer to PFHxA has not been established as characterisation of the degradation products was not undertaken in the biodegradation study. Environmental monitoring data shows that PFHxA, and PFOA which PFHxA-chemistry is replacing, is widely found in the environment, particularly in fresh water close to industrial sources, but also in some biota. Water appears to be the main compartment where PFHxA is found. High measured concentrations of both PFHxA and PFOA in surface waters in Germany have been associated with the legal application of waste materials to agricultural soils (Skutlarek et al., 2006) indicating that these chemicals have the potential to enter the aquatic compartment following initial release into the soil compartment.; By reducing the presence of residual poly- and perfluoroalkyl monomers and impurities in polymers, it is expected that indirect releases from the degradation of polyfluoroalkyl substances will become a significant source of persistent poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances in the environment in the future. PFHxA is already being detected in the environment and as the long chain poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances are phased out in preference for short-chain polyfluoroalkyl chemistry containing a six-carbon perfluorohexyl moiety, the environmental levels of PFHxA are expected to increase.; Perfluoroalkyl substances are expected to be very persistent in the environment (for example, PFOA: t½ (hydrolysis) > 200 years; US EPA 2002) but PFHxA is considered to have low potential for bioaccumulation. There is limited evidence in the published literature of PFHxA toxicity to aquatic organisms on an acute basis, although it is reported to be toxic to marine algae. There is no available data on the long-term aquatic effects of PFHxA.; However, degradants of the notified polymer, along with associated impurities and residual monomers of the notified polymer, are potential precursors of the very persistent chemical, PFHxA.

Nonetheless, the introduction and use of chemicals that degrade to release PFHxA and other very persistent poly- and perfluoroalkyl compounds should be considered a short-term measure until suitable alternatives, with less persistent chemistry, are identified.; • The notifier should seek ways to minimise the level of residual polyfluoroalkyl monomers and impurities in the notified polymer. Such levels should be as low as practicable: where possible, the total weight of these constituents should not exceed the levels attainable utilising international best practice.; − additional information has become available to the person as to an adverse effect of the poly- or perfluoroalkyl degradation products of the notified polymer (such as PFHxA);; − additional information has become available to the person as to the environmental fate of the polymer or its poly- or perfluoroalkyl degradation products (such as PFHxA) in relation to degradation or partitioning behaviour, including during water treatment processes;; Over time, the notified polymer is expected to ultimately degrade into perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) - CAS name: Hexanoic acid, 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,6-undecafluoro-; CAS No. 307-24-4.; The notified polymer is not expected to undergo significant degradation during use. As such, most potential exposure to workers and the public is expected to be to the notified polymer itself, rather than to its degradation products. Exposure to the residual polyfluoroalkyl starting constituents and/or impurities of the notified polymer (discrete polyfluoroalkyl chemicals containing perfluoroalkyl carbon chain lengths ranging from four to ten) is also possible. Such exposure is limited by the relatively low concentration of polyfluoroalkyl impurities in the notified polymer in imported products (up to 1%) and end use products (up to 0.015%).; Inhalation toxicity Perfluoroalkyl chemicals have been known to cause acute lung injury. Acute lung injury is characterised by respiratory problems ranging from mild to severe effects, including mortality, associated with acute or repeated exposures. Acute lung injury is generally considered to be of most concern when the compound has surface activity (Fischer et al., 2012).; Toxicology of break down products The notified polymer contains perfluoroalkyl side-chains that are potential precursors of PFHxA in the environment (PFHxA; CAS No. 307-24-4), a perfluorinated chemical consisting of 5 perfluorinated carbons (a short chain perfluorinated chemical). The polymer that is proposed for replacement by the notified polymer is expected to break down to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA; CAS No. 335-67-1) (consisting of 7 perfluorinated carbons) and other per- and polyfluorocarboxylic substances with longer perfluoroalkyl carbon chain lengths. The toxicokinetic and toxicological properties of the long chain break down products are generally less favourable compared to the short chain break down products, with properties becoming less favourable with increasing perfluoroalkyl carbon chain length. In addition, it has been established that the bioaccumulation potential of perfluorocarboxylic acids increases with perfluoroalkyl carbon chain length (Conder, 2008; Giesy 2010).; A review of the literature indicates that PFHxA has a less hazardous human health profile, compared to PFOA (refer to Appendix D for details). It is therefore inferred that the human health hazards associated with the expected break down product of the notified polymer (PFHxA) are likely to be similar or less than the human health hazards associated with the expected break down products (PFOA and longer chain perfluorocarboxylic acids) of many per- and polyfluoroalkyl chemicals currently on the market and that are intended for replacement by the notified polymer.; Workers may also be exposed to per- and polyfluoroalkyl impurities of the notified polymer at relatively low concentrations (< 1%), during reformulation. It is expected that the engineering controls and personal protective equipment utilised during these operations (as outlined above) will act to mitigate any risk associated with such exposure.; The public may also be exposed to the notified polymer and low levels of per- and polyfluoroalkyl impurities from direct dermal contact with articles that have either been coated or cleaned with products containing the notified polymer.  This exposure may be on a long term repeated basis. However, dermal transfer from the treated article is expected to be low as the notified polymer will be present at low concentrations and will predominantly remain absorbed to the substrate to which it was applied.  Thus the risk to public health from repeated dermal exposure to the notified polymer from treated articles is not considered to be unreasonable. The risk to public health from long term repeated dermal exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl impurities of the notified polymer from treated articles may be mitigated by the relatively low concentrations at which they are present in end use products.; The public may be exposed indirectly to the ultimate break down product of the notified polymer, PFHxA, via the environment. Such exposure may increase over time due to the persistence of PFHxA in the environment. A quantitative risk assessment for this exposure was not conducted. However, the available data indicates that PFHxA has a more favourable toxicological profile and bioaccumulation potential than the long chain per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances that are the ultimate break down products of the majority of polyfluoroalkyl polymers currently in Australian commerce (such as PFOA). In particular, it is noted that the polymer being replaced contains perfluorinated carbon chain lengths > 6. It is concluded that the risks to human health from indirect exposure to breakdown products of polyfluoroalkyl substances will decrease following introduction of the notified polymer, on the basis that the notified polymer is intended to replace a currently available “long” chain polyfluoroalkyl polymer.; The notified polymer applied to surfaces may also degrade as a result of weathering upon being exposed to environmental conditions after use and after disposal. Degradation may result in the widespread release of degradation products such as perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) to surface waters, landfill and landfill leachates, soils, and other regions where release is not foreseen.; Some of the notified polymer may be released to sewer during reformulation, use and disposal. In general, surfactants have the potential to be removed from influent in sewage treatment plants (STP) via partitioning to phase boundaries. Predictions of the environmental partitioning behaviour of polyfluoroalkyl surfactants such as the notified polymer remain uncertain based on current knowledge because of limited data and their unique properties. In particular, the usual predictive models for partitioning during sewage treatment are inapplicable for chemicals containing perfluorinated functionality as they assume lipophilicity for hydrophobic functionality, whereas the perfluorinated functionality is both hydrophobic and lipophobic. The assumption that surface activity and/or high molecular weight results in efficient removal by sorption to sludge during conventional wastewater treatment has not been verified by supporting data for this class of chemical. Thus, noting its potential to disperse in water, a significant proportion of the notified polymer, and any associated impurities/residual monomers of poly- and perfluoroalkyl compounds, may well remain in the aqueous phase following wastewater treatment. As such, the notified polymer and the poly- and perfluoroalkyl impurities/residual monomers in wastewater have the potential to be released in STP effluent directly to surface waters or reused in the irrigation of agricultural soils throughout Australia.; the potential to disperse in water but it is not expected to hydrolyse under environmental conditions (pH 4 to 9, 25 ºC) based on structural considerations. A test study indicates that the notified polymer is rapidly degradable, achieving 62% degradation in 28 days but failing the 10-day window criteria. Degradation products are not known for certain as no characterisation of the degradation products was undertaken in the biodegradation test. A recent paper found that close analogues of the notified polymer undergo rapid biotransformation via a chain shortening mechanism (see Exempt Information). However, the notified polymer is not expected to completely mineralise and degradation products may include more stable lower molecular weight polymers with per- and polyfluoroalkyl functionality or the very persistent perfluorinated degradation product PFHxA. Therefore, the notified polymer has the potential to release the PFHxA after only a short period of time.; In surface waters, agricultural soils and landfill, the notified polymer is expected to eventually degrade to form water, oxides of carbon and nitrogen and degradation products containing per- and polyfluoroalky functionality. The expected initial per- and polyfluoroalkyl degradation products are assumed to undergo further degradation to form, among other compounds, the very persistent perfluorinated degradation product, PFHxA. It is noted that some volatile degradation intermediates have the potential to undergo long range atmospheric transport and thus may result in translocation of PFHxA in the environment. The notified polymer also contains impurities that may degrade to form perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and other long-chain per- and polyfluorocarboxylic acids.; High-temperature incineration is the preferred method of disposal of poly- and perfluoroalkyl compounds due to the environmental persistence characteristics, when it results in mineralisation of the perfluoralkyl functionality to oxides of carbon and hydrofluoric acid. Incomplete combustion of perfluoralkyl functionality may produce an array of partially oxidised fluorocompounds such as perfluoroacetic acid, fluorinated dioxins and furans. Therefore, disposal of the notified polymer and its degradation products by incineration should only take place at facilities that demonstrate complete combustion of the perfluoroalkyl functionality and have adequate measures in place to control release of hydrofluoric acid.; The notified polymer has the potential to bioaccumulate based on its molecular weight and n-octanol/water partition coefficient. Generally, a log Pow of > 4.2 indicates a potential for bioaccumulation as high values indicate a tendency to partition to lipids while a low value indicates a tendency to partition to water. However, this also assumes lipophilicity of the hydrophobic functionality which does not apply to perfluoroalkyl functionality. Certain perfluoroalkyl compounds are known to accumulate in the blood and liver rather than lipids in biological systems (Danish EPA, 2008). As perfluoroalkyl compounds do not follow the usual mechanism for bioaccumulation and are not expected to bioaccumulate in lipids, and because of the notified polymer’s surface-active properties, the n-octanol-water partition coefficient is not considered to be a reliable indicator of bioaccumulation potential for the notified polymer. Further, the notified polymer has the potential to undergo degradation and biotransformation in the environment, reducing its potential to bioaccumulate.; The available laboratory (Higgins et al., 2007; Martin et al., 2003ab; Woodcroft et al., 2010) and field (Falandysz et al., 2006; Falandysz et al., 2007, Furdui et al., 2007) evidence indicates that PFHxA is expected to be less bioaccumulative than PFOA and other long chain perfluoroalkyl compounds, which PFHxA-chemistry is replacing (although PFHxA and PFOA are not considered bioaccumulative).  However, both are bioavailable and can be detected in wildlife as demonstrated by monitoring studies (Kumar et al., 2009; Ye et al., 2008ab; Wang et al., 2008). In aquatic biota, there is little evidence of increased bioconcentration of PFOA compared with PFHxA although PFOA may generally be expected to be found in aquatic organisms more often than PFHxA. In general, the available evidence indicates that the bioaccumulation potential of perfluorinated compounds is correlated with increasing fluorinated carbon chain length (Giesy et al., 2010). Therefore, PFHxA has a lower bioaccumulation potential than PFOA and other long chain perfluorinated compounds, which PFHxA-based chemistry is replacing.; PEC for PFHxA and long chain perfluoroalkyl substances The notified polymer is assumed to degrade and ultimately form the persistent degradant, PFHxA. However, the yield and rate of conversion of the notified polymer to PFHxA has not been established as characterisation of the degradation products was not undertaken in the biodegradation study. Environmental monitoring data shows that PFHxA, and PFOA which PFHxA-chemistry is replacing, is widely found in the environment, particularly in fresh water close to industrial sources, but also in some biota. Water appears to be the main compartment where PFHxA is found. High measured concentrations of both PFHxA and PFOA in surface waters in Germany have been associated with the legal application of waste materials to agricultural soils (Skutlarek et al., 2006) indicating that these chemicals have the potential to enter the aquatic compartment following initial release into the soil compartment.; PFHxA and other poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances have also been found in landfill leachate, with concentrations of PFHxA ranging from 270 – 790 ng/L (Huset et al., 2011).  As landfills are reservoirs of solid waste, and receive waste water treatment plant sludge, which may contain poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances, landfills have the potential to continue to release PFHxA and homologues well into the future.; Historically, release of poly and perfluoroalkyl substances into the environment has been linked to direct releases of low molecular weight poly- and perfluoroalkyl compounds, such as poly- and perfluoroalkyl monomers during polymer manufacture and reformulation processes, rather than breakdown of the polymers themselves. In order to limit the extent of direct release of potential PFHxA precursors to the environment, it is recommended that control measures be implemented to minimise the residual weight percentage of unreacted poly- and perfluoroalkyl monomer constituents and impurities in the notified polymer to the extent practicable. Zhao et al. (2013) report that fluorotelomer alcohol (FTOH) residual raw material content in FTOH-based polymeric products is generally less than 0.1%. Efforts have also been made globally to control releases of perfluoroalkyl acids, such as PFOA and potential precursors, by reducing the presence of residual poly- and perfluoroalkyl monomers and impurities in polymers. It is recommended that the total weight of residual monomers and impurities in the notified polymer containing polyfluoroalkyl functionality should not exceed the levels attainable utilising international best practice and the levels are further reduced using available technological advances, to the extent practicable.; By reducing the presence of residual poly- and perfluoroalkyl monomers and impurities in polymers, it is expected that indirect releases from the degradation of polyfluoroalkyl substances will become a significant source of persistent poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances in the environment in the future. PFHxA is already being detected in the environment and as the long chain poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances are phased out in preference for short-chain polyfluoroalkyl chemistry containing a six-carbon perfluorohexyl moiety, the environmental levels of PFHxA are expected to increase.; Half-lives of polyfluoroalkylated polymers in aerobic soil have so far been found to be indeterminate (Russell et al., 2008; Russell et al., 2010; Washington et al, 2009). The half-lives of PFHxA in various environmental media are also unknown and its partitioning behaviour is uncertain. Further, degradation products of the notified polymer are unknown as characterisation was not undertaken in the biodegradation study. Therefore, a PEC for indirect releases of PFHxA arising from proposed use and disposal of the notified polymer in Australia cannot be determined.; Effects of PFHxA and long chain perfluorocarboxylic acids  There are only limited available toxicity data for PFHxA to organisms, and these are limited to aquatic organisms. Based on the available literature, the most sensitive trophic level is algae. Latala et al., (2009) reported the 72-hour median effect concentrations (72 h EC50) for three marine species as follows: 1.0 mg/L for blue green algae (Geitlerinema amphibium); 1.4 mg/L for diatom (Skeletonema marinoi); and, 4.0 mg/L for green algae (Chlorella vulgaris). The data indicates that PFHxA is toxic to algae on an acute basis. The study also investigated the toxicity of PFOA to the three marine species: 0.25 mg/L for blue green algae; 0.37 mg/L for diatom; and, 0.98 mg/L for green algae. The data indicates that PFOA is very toxic to algae on an acute basis and demonstrate decreased toxicity of PFHxA compared with PFOA to three species tested.; Giesy et al. (2010) reported the relationship between increasing carbon chain length and increasing toxicity. Therefore, PFHxA is expected to have a less problematic ecotoxicological profile than PFOA and other long chain perfluorocarboxylic acids it is expected to replace. Long-term effects data that reflect or model the periods over which perfluorocarboxylic acids are present in the environment are not available for PFHxA or long chain perfluorocarboxylic acids. Therefore, the long-term hazard to aquatic organisms has not been adequately established and is unknown.; Perfluoroalkyl substances are expected to be very persistent in the environment (for example, PFOA: t½ (hydrolysis) > 200 years; US EPA 2002) but PFHxA is considered to have low potential for bioaccumulation. There is limited evidence in the published literature of PFHxA toxicity to aquatic organisms on an acute basis, although it is reported to be toxic to marine algae. There is no available data on the long-term aquatic effects of PFHxA.; The main environmental risks associated with polyfluoroalkyl polymers relate to the release of perfluoroalkyl degradation products such as PFHxA. However, it is not possible to quantify the long-term risks of PFHxA to the environment due to knowledge gaps both in predicting environmental concentrations from indirect sources of release and its long-term environmental effects. . To date, the available data on environmental concentrations of PFHxA indicate a low risk of environmental toxicity. However, the long-term environmental risk profile of PFHxA is currently unknown, and further long term research should ideally be undertaken to characterise this risk.; However, degradants of the notified polymer, along with associated impurities and residual monomers of the notified polymer, are potential precursors of the very persistent chemical, PFHxA. The assessed use pattern of the notified polymer does not control the release of breakdown products into the environment during use and after disposal and the long-term environmental risk profile of PFHxA is currently unknown. Consequently, the long-term risk profile of the notified polymer and its degradation products is unknown. This situation may change if further data on the environmental behaviour of the notified polymer and its poly- and perfluoroalkylated degradation products (including PFHxA) were to become available.; The notified polymer is a potential precursor for PFHxA in the environment, PFHxA, is environmentally persistent and has potential to be globally distributed. However, the ecotoxicological profile and bioaccumulation potential of PFHxA is considered to be less problematic when compared with long chain (C8 and above) perfluoroalkyl acids that PFHxA is expected to replace. Nonetheless, it is recommended that the introduction and use of chemicals that degrade to release PFHxA and other very persistent poly- and perfluoroalkyl compounds should be considered a short-term measure until suitable alternatives, with less persistent chemistry, are identified.; In order to limit the extent of direct release of potential PFHxA and long chain perfluorocarboxylic acid precursors to the environment, it is recommended that control measures be implemented to minimise the residual weight percentage of unreacted polyfluoroalkyl monomer constituents and impurities in the notified; polymer to the extent practicable. Where possible, the total weight of residual monomers and impurities in the notified polymer containing polyfluoroalkyl functionality should not exceed the levels attainable utilising international best practice.

LTD1498,"The notified polymer is intended to be introduced in order to phase out the use of a partially fluorinated polymer containing fluorinated carbon chain lengths > 6 in various proportions (i.e., existing polymer). The use categories of the notified polymer are identical to those of the existing polymer it replaces, as outlined below.","However, the notified polymer is a potential precursor for perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) in the environment, and PFHxA is persistent in the environment. Due to the environmental distribution of PFHxA resulting from the use pattern of the notified polymer, secondary human exposure to PFHxA via the environment may occur. The notified polymer is replacing a long chain polyfluoroalkyl polymer, the latter of which will result in secondary human exposures to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and longer chain perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs). PFOA and longer chain PFCAs are more hazardous to human health and have higher bioaccumulation potential, compared to PFHxA (Russell et al, 2013). The overall human health risk posed by the notified polymer is less than that of the substance it replaces.; However, degradants of the notified polymer, along with associated impurities and residual monomers of the notified polymer, are potential precursors of the very persistent chemical, PFHxA. The assessed use pattern of the notified polymer does not control the release of breakdown products into the environment during use and after disposal and the long-term environmental risk profile of PFHxA is currently unknown. Consequently, the long-term risk profile for the notified polymer and its degradation products is unknown.; The notified polymer is a potential precursor for PFHxA in the environment. PFHxA is an environmentally persistent chemical that has potential to be globally distributed. However, the ecotoxicological profile and bioaccumulation potential of PFHxA is considered to be less problematic when compared with long chain (C8 and above) perfluorocarboxylic acids that PFHxA is expected to replace, noting that current evidence shows that PFHxA was not bioaccumulative in aquatic systems or humans (Russell et al, 2013). Nonetheless, the introduction and use of chemicals that degrade to release PFHxA and other very persistent poly- and perfluoroalkyl compounds should be considered a short-term measure until suitable alternatives, with less persistent chemistry, are identified.; If the notified polymer is released it has the potential to disperse in water but it is not expected to hydrolyse under environmental conditions (pH 4 to 9, 25 C) based on structural considerations. Investigations of the biodegradation potential of fluoroacrylate polymer and fluorotelomer-based urethane polymer in aerobic soils (Russell et al., 2008; Russell et al., 2010; Washington et al., 2009) indicate very limited degradation of the fluorinated polymers. Biodegradation of the backbone of the notified polymer is expected to occur slowly under environmental conditions due to its high molecular weight. Thus, the notified polymer is considered to be persistent in the soil and water compartments.; In surface waters, agricultural soils and landfill, the notified polymer is expected to eventually degrade to form water, oxides of carbon and nitrogen and degradation products containing polyfluoroalkyl functionality. The expected initial polyfluoroalkyl degradation products are assumed to undergo further degradation to form, among other compounds, the very persistent perfluorocarboxylic acid, PFHxA. It is noted that some volatile degradation intermediates have the potential to undergo long range atmospheric transport and thus may result in translocation of PFHxA in the environment. The notified polymer is expected to contain relatively low levels of impurities that may degrade to form PFOA and other long-chain perfluorocarboxylic acids.; PFHxA is expected to be recalcitrant in the environment, and potentially undergo long range transport while mainly staying in the water column. In water, it is expected to be very persistent and will not hydrolyse,; PEC for PFHxA and long chain perfluoroalkyl  substances The notified polymer is assumed to degrade and ultimately form the persistent degradant, PFHxA. However, the yield and rate of conversion of the notified polymer to PFHxA has not been established. Environmental monitoring data shows that PFHxA, and PFOA (which PFHxA-chemistry is replacing) is widely found in the environment, particularly in fresh water close to industrial sources, but also in some biota. Water appears to be the main compartment where PFHxA is found. High measured concentrations of both PFHxA and PFOA in surface waters in Germany have been associated with the legal application of waste materials to agricultural soils (Skutlarek et al., 2006) indicating that these chemicals have the potential to enter the aquatic compartment following initial release into the soil compartment.; source of persistent poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances in the environment in the future. PFHxA is already being detected in the environment and as the long chain poly- and perfluoroalkyl  substances are phased out in preference for short-chain polyfluoroalkyl chemistry containing a six-carbon perfluorohexyl moiety, the environmental levels of PFHxA are expected to increase.; Perfluoroalkyl substances are expected to be very persistent in the environment (for example, PFOA: t½ (hydrolysis) > 200 years; US EPA, 2002) but PFHxA is considered to have low potential for bioaccumulation. There is limited evidence in the published literature of PFHxA toxicity to aquatic organisms on an acute basis, although it is reported to be toxic to marine algae. There is no available data on the long-term aquatic effects of PFHxA.; However, degradants of the notified polymer, along with associated impurities and residual monomers of the notified polymer, are potential precursors of the persistent chemical, PFHxA. The assessed use pattern of the notified polymer does not control the release of breakdown products into the environment during use and after disposal and the long-term environmental risk profile of PFHxA is currently unknown. Consequently, the long-term risk profile of the notified polymer and its degradation products is unknown.

Due to the environmental distribution of PFHxA resulting from the use pattern of the notified polymer, secondary human exposure to PFHxA via the environment may occur. The notified polymer is replacing a long chain polyfluoroalkyl polymer, the latter of which will result in secondary human exposures to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and longer chain perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs). PFOA and longer chain PFCAs are more hazardous to human health and have higher bioaccumulation potential, compared to PFHxA (Russell et al, 2013). The overall human health risk posed by the notified polymer is less than that of the substance it replaces.; The notified polymer is a potential precursor for PFHxA in the environment. PFHxA is an environmentally persistent chemical that has potential to be globally distributed. However, the ecotoxicological profile and bioaccumulation potential of PFHxA is considered to be less problematic when compared with long chain (C8 and above) perfluorocarboxylic acids that PFHxA is expected to replace, noting that current evidence shows that PFHxA was not bioaccumulative in aquatic systems or humans (Russell et al, 2013). Nonetheless, the introduction and use of chemicals that degrade to release PFHxA and other very persistent poly- and perfluoroalkyl compounds should be considered a short-term measure until suitable alternatives, with less persistent chemistry, are identified.; • The notified polymer should only be introduced as part of a strategy to phase out the use of long chain perfluoroalkyl chemicals.; • The notifier should seek ways to minimise the level of residual polyfluoroalkyl monomers and impurities in the notified polymer. Such levels should be as low as practicable: where possible, the total weight of these constituents should not exceed the levels attainable utilising international best practice.; • If the notified polymer or products containing the notified polymer cannot feasibly be disposed using a technique that will destroy or irreversibly transform the perfluoroalkyl components of the notified polymer, disposal should be to landfill.; − additional information has become available to the person as to an adverse effect of the poly- or perfluoroalkylated degradation products of the notified polymer (such as perfluorohexanoic acid);; − additional information has become available to the person as to the environmental fate of the polymer or its poly- or perfluoroalkylated degradation products (such as perfluorohexanoic acid) in relation to degradation or partitioning behaviour, including during water treatment processes;; The notified polymer contains a polyfluoroalkyl carbon side chain with six perfluorinated carbons.; The notified polymer is a potential precursor for PFHxA in the environment (PFHxA - perfluorohexanoic acid  - CAS name: Hexanoic acid, 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,6-undecafluoro-; CAS No. 307-24-4).; Adsorption/Desorption Not determined Generally, polymers similar to the notified polymer are expected to adsorb to soil, sediments and sludge. However, the notified polymer may have low absorption based on the presence of perfluoroalkyl; The notified polymer may undergo slow degradation in the environment. As such, most potential exposure to workers and the public is expected to be to the notified polymer itself, rather than to its degradation products. Exposure to the residual polyfluoroalkyl starting constituents and/or impurities of the notified polymer (discrete polyfluoroalkyl chemicals containing perfluoroalkyl carbon chain lengths ranging from four to ten) is also possible. Such exposure is limited by the low concentration of polyfluoroalkyl impurities in the notified polymer, in the imported products or in end-use products.; Toxicology of breakdown products The notified polymer contains perfluoroalkyl side-chains that are potential precursors of PFHxA in the environment (PFHxA; CAS No. 307-24-4). PFHxA is a perfluorocarboxylic acid consisting of 5 perfluorinated carbons (a short chain perfluorinated chemical). The polymer that is proposed for replacement by the notified polymer is expected to breakdown to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA; CAS No. 335-67-1) (consisting of 7 perfluorinated carbons) and other per- and polyfluorocarboxylic substances with longer perfluoroalkyl carbon chain lengths. The toxicokinetic and toxicological properties of the long chain breakdown products are generally less favourable compared to the short chain breakdown products, with properties becoming less favourable with increasing perfluoroalkyl carbon chain length. In addition, it has been established that the bioaccumulation potential of perfluorocarboxylic acids increases with perfluoroalkyl carbon chain length (Conder, 2008; Giesy 2010).; A review of the literature indicates that PFHxA has a less hazardous human health profile, compared to PFOA (refer to Appendix D for details). It is therefore inferred that the human health hazards associated with the expected breakdown product of the notified polymer (PFHxA) are likely to be similar or less than the human health hazards associated with the expected breakdown products (PFOA and longer chain perfluorocarboxylic; acids) of many per- and polyfluoroalkyl chemicals currently on the market and that are intended for replacement by the notified polymer.; Workers may also be exposed to perfluoroalkyl impurities of the notified polymer at relatively low concentrations (< 1 wt%). It is expected that the engineering controls and personal protective equipment utilised during these operations (as outlined above) will act to mitigate any risk associated with such exposure.; Slight eye irritation resulting from ocular exposure to the notified chemical is not expected based on the low concentration in end-use products (up to 3 wt% concentration). Dermal exposure to the notified polymer (up to 3 wt% concentration) is not expected to result in adverse effects, based on the low toxicity of the notified polymer. Additionally, the risk to public health from exposures to perfluoroalkyl impurities during use of products containing the notified polymer (up to 3 wt% concentration) is not considered to be unreasonable based on their low concentration (< 0.1 wt%) in end-use products.; Therefore, the risk to public health from exposures to the notified polymer and perfluoroalkyl impurities during application of stone and tile products is not considered to be unreasonable.; The public may be exposed to the notified polymer and relatively low levels of perfluoroalkyl impurities through dermal contact with treated stone and tile surfaces. This exposure may be on a long term repeated basis. Repeated dose toxicity studies generally indicated low repeated dose toxicity for the notified polymer, additionally the high molecular weight (> 10,000 Da) of the notified polymer is expected to prevent any significant dermal absorption. The risk to public health from repeated dermal contact with the notified polymer is not considered to be unreasonable. Additionally, the risk to public health from exposures to perfluoroalkyl impurities resulting from dermal contact with treated surfaces is not considered to be unreasonable based on their low concentration (< 0.1 wt%) in end-use products.; The public may be exposed indirectly to PFHxA, formed by degradation of the notified polymer in the environment. Such exposure may increase over time due to the persistence of PFHxA in the environment. A quantitative risk assessment for this exposure was not conducted. However, the available data indicates that PFHxA has a more favourable toxicological profile and bioaccumulation potential than the long chain perfluoroalkyl substances that are the ultimate breakdown products of the majority of perfluoroalkyl polymers currently in Australian commerce (such as PFOA). In particular, it is noted that the polymer being replaced contains perfluoroalkyl carbon chain lengths > 6. It is concluded that the risks to human health from indirect exposure to breakdown products of perfluoroalkyl substances will decrease following introduction of the notified polymer, on the basis that the notified polymer is intended to replace a currently available “long” chain perfluoroalkyl polymer.; Some of the notified polymer may be released to sewer during reformulation, use and disposal. In general, cationic polymers have the potential to be removed from influent in sewage treatment plants (STP) via sorption to sludge. However, predictions of the environmental partitioning behaviour of polyfluoroalkyl polymers remain uncertain based on current knowledge because of limited data and their unique properties. In particular, the usual predictive models for partitioning during sewage treatment are inapplicable for chemicals containing perfluoroalkyl functionality as they assume lipophilicity for hydrophobic functionality, whereas the perfluoroalkyl functionality is both hydrophobic and lipophobic. The assumption that cationicity and/or high molecular weight results in efficient removal by sorption to sludge during conventional wastewater treatment has not been verified by supporting data for this class of chemical. Thus, noting the potential for the notified polymer to disperse in water, the notified polymer, and any associated degradation products and/or impurities/residual monomers of poly- or perfluoroalkyl compounds, may remain in the aqueous phase following wastewater treatment. As such, the notified polymer, its degradation products and the poly- or perfluoroalkyl impurities/residual monomers in wastewater have the potential to be released in STP effluent directly to surface waters or reused in the irrigation of agricultural soils throughout Australia.; In surface waters, agricultural soils and landfill, the notified polymer is expected to eventually degrade to form water, oxides of carbon and nitrogen and degradation products containing polyfluoroalkyl functionality. The expected initial polyfluoroalkyl degradation products are assumed to undergo further degradation to form, among other compounds, the very persistent perfluorocarboxylic acid, PFHxA. It is noted that some volatile degradation intermediates have the potential to undergo long range atmospheric transport and thus may result in translocation of PFHxA in the environment. The notified polymer is expected to contain relatively low levels of impurities that may degrade to form PFOA and other long-chain perfluorocarboxylic acids.; High-temperature incineration is the preferred method of disposal of poly- and perfluoroalkyl compounds due to the environmental persistence characteristics, when it results in mineralisation of the perfluoralkyl functionality to oxides of carbon and hydrofluoric acid. Incomplete combustion of perfluoralkyl functionality may produce an array of partially oxidised fluorocompounds. Therefore, disposal of the notified polymer and its degradation products by incineration should only take place at facilities that demonstrate complete combustion of the perfluoroalkyl functionality and have adequate measures in place to control release of hydrofluoric acid.; Due to its high molecular weight which limits the ability to cross biological membrane, the notified polymer is not expected to bioaccumulate. The available laboratory (Higgins et al., 2007; Martin et al., 2003ab; Woodcroft et al., 2010) and field (Falandysz et al., 2006; Falandysz et al., 2007, Furdui et al., 2007) evidence indicates that PFHxA is expected to be less bioaccumulative than PFOA and other long chain perfluoroalkylated compounds, which short-chain six-fluorinated carbon fluorotelomer chemistry, that may degrade to form PFHxA, is replacing (although PFHxA and PFOA are not considered bioaccumulative in aquatic ecosystems). However, both are bioavailable and have been detected in wildlife as demonstrated by monitoring studies (Kumar et al., 2009; Ye et al., 2008ab; Wang et al., 2008). In general, the available evidence indicates that the bioaccumulation potential of perfluoroalkyl compounds is correlated with increasing carbon chain length (Giesy et al., 2010). Therefore, PFHxA has a lower bioaccumulation potential than PFOA and other long chain perfluoroalkyl substances.; PEC for PFHxA and long chain perfluoroalkyl  substances The notified polymer is assumed to degrade and ultimately form the persistent degradant, PFHxA. However, the yield and rate of conversion of the notified polymer to PFHxA has not been established. Environmental monitoring data shows that PFHxA, and PFOA (which PFHxA-chemistry is replacing) is widely found in the environment, particularly in fresh water close to industrial sources, but also in some biota. Water appears to be the main compartment where PFHxA is found. High measured concentrations of both PFHxA and PFOA in surface waters in Germany have been associated with the legal application of waste materials to agricultural soils (Skutlarek et al., 2006) indicating that these chemicals have the potential to enter the aquatic compartment following initial release into the soil compartment.; PFHxA and other poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances have also been found in landfill leachate, with concentrations of PHFxA ranging from 270 – 790 ng/L (Huset et al., 2011).  As landfills are reservoirs of solid waste, and receive waste water treatment plant sludge, which may contain poly- and perfluoroalkyl  substances, landfills have the potential to continue to release PFHxA and homologues well into the future.; Historically, release of poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances into the environment has been linked to direct releases of low molecular weight poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances, such as poly- and perfluoroalkyl monomers during polymer manufacture and reformulation processes, rather than breakdown of the polymers themselves. In order to limit the extent of direct release of potential PFHxA precursors to the environment, it is recommended that control measures be implemented to minimise the residual weight percentage of unreacted poly- and perfluoroalkyl monomer constituents and impurities in the notified polymer to the extent practicable. Zhao et al. (2013) report that fluorotelomer alcohol (FTOH) residual raw material content in FTOH-based polymeric products is generally less than 0.1%. Efforts have also been made globally to control releases of perfluoroalkyl acids, such as PFOA and potential precursors, by reducing the presence of residual poly- and perfluoroalkyl monomers and impurities in polymers. It is recommended that the total weight of residual monomers and impurities in the notified polymer containing polyfluoroalkyl functionality should not exceed the levels attainable utilising international best practice and the levels are further reduced using available technological advances, to the extent practicable.; By reducing the presence of residual poly- and perfluoroalkyl monomers and impurities in polymers, it is expected that indirect releases from the degradation of polyfluoroalkyl substances will become a significant; source of persistent poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances in the environment in the future. PFHxA is already being detected in the environment and as the long chain poly- and perfluoroalkyl  substances are phased out in preference for short-chain polyfluoroalkyl chemistry containing a six-carbon perfluorohexyl moiety, the environmental levels of PFHxA are expected to increase.; Half-lives of polyfluoroalkyl polymers in aerobic soil have been found to be indeterminate, with calculated half-lives ranging from decades to millennia (Russell et al., 2008; Russell et al., 2010; Washington et al, 2009). The half-lives of PFHxA in various environmental media are also unknown and its partitioning behaviour is uncertain. Further, degradation products of the notified polymer are unknown based on the information provided by the notifier. Therefore, a PEC for indirect releases of PFHxA arising from proposed use and disposal of the notified polymer in Australia cannot be determined.; Effects of PFHxA and long chain perfluorocarboxylic acids  There are only limited available toxicity data for PFHxA to organisms, and these are limited to aquatic organisms. Based on the available literature, the most sensitive trophic level is algae. Latala et al., (2009) reported the 72-hour median effect concentrations (72 h EC50) for three marine species as follows: 1.0 mg/L for blue green algae (Geitlerinema amphibium); 1.4 mg/L for diatom (Skeletonema marinoi); and, 4.0 mg/L for green algae (Chlorella vulgaris). The data indicates that PFHxA is toxic to algae on an acute basis. The study also investigated the toxicity of PFOA to the three marine species: 0.25 mg/L for blue green algae; 0.37 mg/L for diatom; and, 0.98 mg/L for green algae. The data indicates that PFOA is very toxic to algae on an acute basis and demonstrate decreased toxicity of PFHxA compared with PFOA to three species tested.; Giesy et al. (2010) reported the relationship between increasing carbon chain length and increasing toxicity. Therefore, PFHxA is expected to have a less problematic ecotoxicological profile than PFOA and other long chain perfluorocarboxylic acids it is expected to replace. Long-term effects data that reflect or model the periods over which perfluorocarboxylic acids are present in the environment are not available for PFHxA or long chain perfluorocarboxylic acids. Therefore, the long-term hazard to aquatic organisms has not been adequately established and is unknown.; Perfluoroalkyl substances are expected to be very persistent in the environment (for example, PFOA: t½ (hydrolysis) > 200 years; US EPA, 2002) but PFHxA is considered to have low potential for bioaccumulation. There is limited evidence in the published literature of PFHxA toxicity to aquatic organisms on an acute basis, although it is reported to be toxic to marine algae. There is no available data on the long-term aquatic effects of PFHxA.; The main environmental risks associated with polyfluoroalkyl polymers relate to the release of perfluoroalkyl degradation products such as PFHxA. However, it is not possible to quantify the long-term risks of PFHxA to the environment due to knowledge gaps both in predicting environmental concentrations from indirect sources of release and its long-term environmental effects. To date, the available data on environmental concentrations of PFHxA indicate a low risk of environmental toxicity. However, the long-term environmental risk profile of PFHxA is currently unknown, and further long term research should ideally be undertaken to characterise this risk.; PFHxA is already wide-spread in surface waters and biota. Continuing release of PFHxA which has no known breakdown mechanism (at least in soil and water) could result in increasing environmental concentrations over time. Hence, there is potential for ecotoxicologically significant concentrations to eventually be reached following its accumulation in the environment. In this eventuality, precursors of PFHxA such as the notified polymer cannot be recalled after release and are a potential source of PFHxA in the environment even long after their use ceases. Thus, use and disposal of the notified polymer increases the environmental risk profile of PFHxA.

In order to limit the extent of direct release of potential PFHxA precursors to the environment, it is recommended that control measures be implemented to minimise the residual weight percentage of unreacted poly- and perfluoroalkyl monomer constituents and impurities in the notified polymer to the extent practicable. Zhao et al. (2013) report that fluorotelomer alcohol (FTOH) residual raw material content in FTOH-based polymeric products is generally less than 0.1%. Efforts have also been made globally to control releases of perfluoroalkyl acids, such as PFOA and potential precursors, by reducing the presence of residual poly- and perfluoroalkyl monomers and impurities in polymers. It is recommended that the total weight of residual monomers and impurities in the notified polymer containing polyfluoroalkyl functionality should not exceed the levels attainable utilising international best practice and the levels are further reduced using available technological advances, to the extent practicable.; PFHxA is already wide-spread in surface waters and biota. Continuing release of PFHxA which has no known breakdown mechanism (at least in soil and water) could result in increasing environmental concentrations over time.

The AUC for potential human exposure at the OEL was compared with the AUC values at the experimentally derived NOAECs for the two animal species, to determine a corresponding margin of safety. The margin of safety ratios for rabbits were calculated to be 14-26, depending on the exposure duration; 14 corresponds to human exposure for 8 h/day and rabbit exposure for 6 h/day.  The margin of safety ratios for rats were calculated as 188-349, depending on the exposure duration; 188 corresponds to human exposure for 8 h/day and rat exposure for 6 h/day. The results indicate that higher exposure is required for the human to reach the animal dosimetric, for both the rabbit and rat scenarios.

The AUC in the CF model was calculated as approximately 1.2 mg/L·h.

LTD1536,"The notified polymer is intended to be introduced in order to phase out the use of a partially fluorinated polymer containing fluorinated carbon chain lengths > 6 in various proportions (i.e., existing polymer). The use categories of the notified polymer are identical to those of the existing polymer it replaces, as outlined below.","However, the notified polymer is a potential precursor for perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) in the environment, and PFHxA is persistent in the environment. Due to the environmental distribution of PFHxA resulting from the use pattern of the notified polymer, secondary human exposure to PFHxA via the environment may occur. The notified polymer is replacing a long chain polyfluoroalkyl polymer, the latter of which will result in secondary human exposures to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and longer chain perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs). PFOA and longer chain PFCAs are more hazardous to human health and have higher bioaccumulation potential, compared to PFHxA. The overall human health risk posed by the notified polymer is less than that of the substance it replaces.; However, degradants of the notified polymer, along with associated impurities and residual monomers of the notified polymer, are potential precursors of the very persistent chemical, PFHxA. The assessed use pattern of the notified polymer does not control the release of breakdown products into the environment during use and after disposal and there are no adequate long-term environmental effects data for PFHxA. Therefore, the long-term environmental implications are unknown. Consequently, the long-term risk cannot be quantified for the notified polymer and its degradation products. In order to inform a more conclusive assessment of long-term environmental risks, further data should be generated. This may include data on longer-term environmental effects, as well as partitioning behaviour and characterisation of the degradation products, for the notified polymer and/or poly- and perfluoroalkyl degradation products (including PFHxA).; The notified polymer is a potential precursor for PFHxA in the environment. PFHxA is an environmentally persistent chemical that has potential to be globally distributed. However, the ecotoxicological profile and bioaccumulation potential of PFHxA is considered to be less problematic when compared with long chain (C8 and above) perfluorocarboxylic acids that PFHxA is expected to replace, noting that current evidence suggests PFHxA was not bioaccumulative in aquatic ecosystems. Nonetheless, the introduction and use of chemicals that degrade to release PFHxA and other very persistent poly- and perfluoroalkyl compounds should be considered a short-term measure until suitable alternatives, with less persistent chemistry, are identified.; The notified polymer may have the potential to disperse in water but it is not expected to hydrolyse under environmental conditions (pH 4 to 9, 25 ºC) based on structural considerations. No data regarding biodegradation of the notified polymer is available. Degradation of the notified polymer is expected to be very slow. The notified polymer is not expected to completely mineralise and degradation products may include more stable lower molecular weight polymer with poly- or perfluoroalkyl functionality or the very persistent perfluorocarboxylic acid, PFHxA. Therefore, the notified polymer has the potential to release PFHxA.; In surface waters, agricultural soils and landfill, the notified polymer is expected to eventually degrade to form water, oxides of carbon and nitrogen and degradation products containing polyfluoroalkyl functionality. The expected initial polyfluoroalkyl degradation products are assumed to undergo further degradation to form, among other compounds, the very persistent perfluorocarboxylic acid degradation product, PFHxA. It is noted that some volatile degradation intermediates have the potential to undergo long range atmospheric transport and thus may result in translocation of PFHxA in the environment. The notified polymer also contains relatively low levels of impurities that may degrade to form perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and other long-chain perfluorocarboxylic acids.; PFHxA is expected to be recalcitrant in the environment, and potentially undergo long range transport while mainly staying in the water column. In water, it is expected to be very persistent and will not hydrolyse, photolyse or biodegrade.; PEC for PFHxA and long chain perfluoroalkyl substances The notified polymer is assumed to degrade and ultimately form the persistent degradant, PFHxA. However, the yield and rate of conversion of the notified polymer to PFHxA has not been established. Environmental monitoring data shows that PFHxA, and PFOA which PFHxA-chemistry is replacing, is widely found in the environment, particularly in fresh water close to industrial sources, but also in some biota. Water appears to be the main compartment where PFHxA is found. High measured concentrations of both PFHxA and PFOA in surface waters in Germany have been associated with the legal application of waste materials to agricultural soils (Skutlarek et al., 2006) indicating that these chemicals have the potential to enter the aquatic compartment following initial release into the soil compartment.; By reducing the presence of residual poly- and perfluoroalkyl monomers and impurities in polymers, it is expected that indirect releases from the degradation of polyfluoroalkyl substances will become a significant source of persistent poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances in the environment in the future. PFHxA is already being detected in the environment and as the long chain poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances are phased out in preference for short-chain polyfluoroalkyl chemistry containing a six-carbon perfluorohexyl moiety, the environmental levels of PFHxA are expected to increase.; Perfluoroalkyl substances are expected to be very persistent in the environment (for example, PFOA: t½ (hydrolysis) > 200 years; US EPA 2002) but PFHxA is considered to have low potential for bioaccumulation. There is limited evidence in the published literature of PFHxA toxicity to aquatic organisms on an acute basis, although it is reported to be toxic to marine algae. There is no available data on the long-term aquatic effects of PFHxA.; However, degradants of the notified polymer, along with associated impurities and residual monomers of the notified polymer, are potential precursors of the very persistent chemical, perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA). The assessed use pattern of the notified polymer does not control the release of breakdown products into the environment during use and after disposal and there are no adequate long-term environmental effects data for PFHxA.

Such levels should be as low as practicable: where possible, the total weight of these constituents should not exceed the levels attainable utilising international best practice.; • If the notified polymer or products containing the notified polymer cannot feasibly be disposed using a technique that will destroy or irreversibly transform the perfluoroalkyl components of the notified polymer, disposal should be to landfill.; − additional information has become available to the person as to an adverse effect of the polyfluoroalkyl degradation products of the notified polymer (such as perfluorohexanoic acid);; − additional information has become available to the person as to the environmental fate of the polymer or its polyfluoroalkyl degradation products (such as perfluorohexanoic acid) in relation to degradation or partitioning behaviour, including during water treatment processes;; The notified polymer contains a polyfluoroalkyl carbon side chain with six perfluorinated carbons.; The notified polymer is a potential precursor for PFHxA in the environment  (PFHxA: perfluorohexanoic acid  - CAS name: Hexanoic acid, 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,6-undecafluoro-; CAS No. 307-24-4).; absorption based on its potential to disperse in water and presence of perfluoroalkyl functionalities which have both hydrophobic and lipophobic tendencies.; The notified polymer may undergo slow degradation in the environment. As such, most potential exposure to workers and the public is expected to be to the notified polymer itself, rather than to its degradation products. Exposure to the residual polyfluoroalkyl starting constituents and/or impurities of the notified polymer (discrete polyfluoroalkyl chemicals containing perfluoroalkyl carbon chain lengths ranging from four to ten) is also possible. Such exposure is limited by the relatively low concentration of polyfluoroalkyl impurities in the notified polymer in the imported products (up to 1%) or in end-use products (up to 0.01%).; The notified polymer is a potential precursor for perfluorohexanoic acid in the environment. Thisis likely to lead to secondary human exposure to PFHxA. This exposure is unquantifiable.; There may also be potential for members of the public to inhale or ingest small quantities of fabric/furnishing fibres or household dust from indoor environments. This may involve the inhalation or ingestion of fibres to which the notified polymer is bound, or perhaps inhalation or ingestion of the notified polymer itself (present in household dust that has been removed from the articles), or polyfluoroalkyl impurities of the notified polymer.; Toxicology of break down products The notified polymer contains perfluoroalkylside-chains that are potential precursors of PFHxAin the environment (PFHxA; CAS No. 307-24-4). PFHxA is a perfluorocarboxylic acid consisting of 5 perfluorinated carbons (a short chain perfluorinated chemical). The polymer that is proposed for replacement by the notified polymer is expected to break down to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA; CAS No. 335-67-1) (consisting of 7 perfluorinated carbons) and other per- and polyfluorocarboxylic substances with longer perfluoroalkyl carbon chain lengths. The toxicokinetic and toxicological properties of the long chain break down products are generally less favourable compared to the short chain break down products, with properties becoming less favourable with increasing perfluoroalkyl carbon chain length. In addition, it has been established that the bioaccumulation potential of perfluorocarboxylic acids increases with perfluoroalkyl carbon chain length (Conder, 2008; Giesy 2010).; A review of the literature indicates that PFHxA has a less hazardous human health profile, compared to PFOA (refer to Appendix D for details). It is therefore inferred that the human health hazards associated with the expected break down product of the notified polymer (PFHxA) are likely to be similar or less than the human health hazards associated with the expected break down products (PFOA and longer chain perfluorocarboxylic acids) of many per- and polyfluoroalkyl chemicals currently on the market and that are intended for replacement by the notified polymer.; Workers may also be exposed to perfluoroalkyl impurities of the notified polymer at relatively low concentrations (< 1%). It is expected that the engineering controls and personal protective equipment utilised during these operations (as outlined above) will act to mitigate any risk associated with such exposure.; The public may be exposed to the notified polymer and relatively low levels of perfluoroalkyl impurities through dermal contact with treated articles, such as carpets and furnishings. This exposure may be on a long term repeated basis. Repeated dose toxicity studies with the notified polymer were indicative of low hazard and the high molecular weight (> 1,000 Da) of the notified polymer is expected to prevent any significant dermal absorption. The risk to public health from repeated dermal contact with the notified polymer is not considered to be unreasonable. Additionally, the risk to public health from exposures to perfluoroalkyl impurities is not considered to be unreasonable based on their low concentration (< 0.01%) in end-use products.; The public may be exposed indirectly to PFHxA, formed by degradation of the notified polymer in the environment. Such exposure may increase over time due to the persistence of PFHxA in the environment. A quantitative risk assessment for this exposure was not conducted. However, the available data indicates that PFHxA has a more favourable toxicological profile and bioaccumulation potential than the long chain perfluoroalkyl substances that are the ultimate break down products of the majority of perfluoroalkyl polymers currently in Australian commerce (such as PFOA). In particular, it is noted that the polymer being replaced contains perfluoroalkyl carbon chain lengths > 6. It is concluded that the risks to human health from indirect exposure to breakdown products of perfluoroalkyl substances will decrease following introduction of the notified polymer, on the basis that the notified polymer is intended to replace a currently available “long” chain perfluoroalkyl polymer.; About 30% of the notified polymer is expected to be released to sewer in washing water from carpet cleaning processes. In general, non-ionic polymers with a molecular weight of more than 1000 Da are considered to be efficiently removed in sewage treatment plant (STP) processes through adsorption to sludge. Predictions of the environmental partitioning behaviour of polyfluoroalkyl compounds such as the notified polymer remain uncertain based on current knowledge because of limited data and their unique properties. In particular, the usual predictive models for partitioning during sewage treatment are inapplicable for chemicals containing perfluoroalkyl functionality as they assume lipophilicity for hydrophobic functionality, whereas the perfluoroalkyl functionality is both hydrophobic and lipophobic. The assumption that surface activity and/or high molecular weight results in efficient removal by sorption to sludge during conventional wastewater treatment has not been verified by supporting data for this class of polymer. Thus, noting its potential of being both hydrophobic and lipophobic, the notified polymer, and any associated degradation products and/or impurities/residual monomers of poly- or perfluoroalkyl compounds, may remain in the aqueous phase following wastewater treatment. As such, the notified polymer, its degradation products and the poly- or perfluoroalkyl impurities/residual monomers in wastewater have the potential to be released in STP effluent directly to surface waters or reused in the irrigation of agricultural soils throughout Australia.; The notified polymer may have the potential to disperse in water but it is not expected to hydrolyse under environmental conditions (pH 4 to 9, 25 ºC) based on structural considerations. No data regarding biodegradation of the notified polymer is available. Degradation of the notified polymer is expected to be very slow. The notified polymer is not expected to completely mineralise and degradation products may include more stable lower molecular weight polymer with poly- or perfluoroalkyl functionality or the very persistent perfluorocarboxylic acid, PFHxA. Therefore, the notified polymer has the potential to release PFHxA.; In surface waters, agricultural soils and landfill, the notified polymer is expected to eventually degrade to form water, oxides of carbon and nitrogen and degradation products containing polyfluoroalkyl functionality. The expected initial polyfluoroalkyl degradation products are assumed to undergo further degradation to form, among other compounds, the very persistent perfluorocarboxylic acid degradation product, PFHxA. It is noted that some volatile degradation intermediates have the potential to undergo long range atmospheric transport and thus may result in translocation of PFHxA in the environment. The notified polymer also contains relatively low levels of impurities that may degrade to form perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and other long-chain perfluorocarboxylic acids.; High-temperature incineration is the preferred method of disposal of poly- and perfluoroalkyl compounds due to the environmental persistence characteristics, when it results in mineralisation of the perfluoroalkyl functionality to oxides of carbon and hydrofluoric acid. Incomplete combustion of perfluoroalkyl functionality may produce an array of partially oxidised fluorocompounds. Therefore, disposal of the notified polymer and its degradation products by incineration should only take place at facilities that demonstrate complete combustion of the perfluoroalkyl functionality and have adequate measures in place to control release of hydrofluoric acid.; Due to its high molecular weight which limits the ability to cross biological membranes, the notified polymer is not expected to bioaccumulate. The available laboratory (Higgins et al., 2007; Martin et al., 2003ab; Woodcroft et al., 2010) and field (Falandysz et al., 2006; Falandysz et al., 2007, Furdui et al., 2007) evidence indicates that PFHxA is expected to be less bioaccumulative than PFOA and other long chain perfluoroalkylated compounds, which PFHxA- chemistry is replacing (although PFHxA and PFOA are not considered bioaccumulative). However, both are bioavailable and can be detected in wildlife as demonstrated by monitoring studies (Kumar et al., 2009; Ye et al., 2008a; Ye et al., 2008b; Wang et al., 2008). In general, the available evidence indicates that the bioaccumulation potential of perfluoroalkyl compounds is correlated with increasing carbon chain length (Giesy et al., 2010). Therefore, PFHxA has a lower bioaccumulation potential than PFOA and other long chain perfluoroalkyl substances; PEC for PFHxA and long chain perfluoroalkyl substances The notified polymer is assumed to degrade and ultimately form the persistent degradant, PFHxA. However, the yield and rate of conversion of the notified polymer to PFHxA has not been established. Environmental monitoring data shows that PFHxA, and PFOA which PFHxA-chemistry is replacing, is widely found in the environment, particularly in fresh water close to industrial sources, but also in some biota. Water appears to be the main compartment where PFHxA is found. High measured concentrations of both PFHxA and PFOA in surface waters in Germany have been associated with the legal application of waste materials to agricultural soils (Skutlarek et al., 2006) indicating that these chemicals have the potential to enter the aquatic compartment following initial release into the soil compartment.; PFHxA and other poly- and perfluoroalkyl compounds have also been found in landfill leachate, with concentrations of PFHxA ranging from 270 – 790 ng/L (Huset et al., 2011).  As landfills are reservoirs of solid waste, and receive waste water treatment plant sludge, which may contain poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances, landfills have the potential to continue to release PFHxA and homologues well into the future.; Historically, release of poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances into the environment has been linked to direct releases of low molecular weight poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances, such as poly- and perfluoroalkyl monomers during polymer manufacture and reformulation processes, rather than breakdown of the polymers themselves. In order to limit the extent of direct release of potential PFHxA precursors to the environment, it is recommended that control measures be implemented to minimise the residual weight percentage of unreacted poly- and perfluoroalkyl monomer constituents and impurities in the notified polymer to the extent practicable. Zhao et al. (2013) report that fluorotelomer alcohol (FTOH) residual raw material content in FTOH-based polymeric products is generally less than 0.1%. Efforts have also been made globally to control releases of perfluoroalkyl acids, such as PFOA and potential precursors, by reducing the presence of residual poly- and perfluoroalkyl monomers and impurities in polymers. It is recommended that the total weight of residual monomers and impurities in the notified polymer containing polyfluoroalkyl functionality should not exceed the levels attainable utilising international best practice and the levels are further reduced using available technological advances, to the extent practicable; By reducing the presence of residual poly- and perfluoroalkyl monomers and impurities in polymers, it is expected that indirect releases from the degradation of polyfluoroalkyl substances will become a significant source of persistent poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances in the environment in the future. PFHxA is already being detected in the environment and as the long chain poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances are phased out in preference for short-chain polyfluoroalkyl chemistry containing a six-carbon perfluorohexyl moiety, the environmental levels of PFHxA are expected to increase.; Half-lives of polyfluoroalkyl polymers in aerobic soil have been found to be indeterminate with calculated half-lives ranging from decades to millennia (Russell et al., 2008; Russell et al., 2010; Washington et al, 2009). The half-lives of PFHxA in various environmental media are also unknown and its partitioning behaviour is uncertain. Further, degradation products of the notified polymer are unknown as no biodegradation study is available. Therefore, a PEC for indirect releases of PFHxA arising from proposed use and disposal of the notified polymer in Australia cannot be determined.; Effects of PFHxA and long chain perfluorocarboxylic acids: There are only limited available toxicity data for PFHxA to organisms, and these are limited to aquatic organisms. Based on the available literature, the most sensitive trophic level is algae. Latala et al., (2009) reported the 72-hour median effect concentrations (72 h EC50) for three marine species as follows: 1.0 mg/L for blue green algae (Geitlerinema amphibium); 1.4 mg/L for diatom (Skeletonema marinoi); and, 4.0 mg/L for green algae (Chlorella vulgaris). The data indicates that PFHxA is toxic to algae on an acute basis. The study also investigated the toxicity of PFOA to the three marine species: 0.25 mg/L for blue green algae; 0.37 mg/L for diatom; and, 0.98 mg/L for green algae. The data indicates that PFOA is very toxic to algae on an acute basis and demonstrate decreased toxicity of PFHxA compared with PFOA to three species tested.; Giesy et al. (2010) reported the relationship between increasing carbon chain length and increasing toxicity. Therefore, PFHxA is expected to have a less problematic ecotoxicological profile than PFOA and other long chain perfluorocarboxylic acids it is expected to replace. Long-term effects data that reflect or model the periods over which perfluorocarboxylic acids are present in the environment are not available for PFHxA or long chain perfluorocarboxylic acids. Therefore, the long-term hazard to aquatic organisms has not been adequately established and is unknown.; Perfluoroalkyl substances are expected to be very persistent in the environment (for example, PFOA: t½ (hydrolysis) > 200 years; US EPA 2002) but PFHxA is considered to have low potential for bioaccumulation. There is limited evidence in the published literature of PFHxA toxicity to aquatic organisms on an acute basis, although it is reported to be toxic to marine algae. There is no available data on the long-term aquatic effects of PFHxA.; The main environmental risks associated with polyfluoroalkyl polymers relate to the release of perfluoroalkyl degradation products such as PFHxA. However, it is not possible to quantify the long-term risks of PFHxA to the environment due to knowledge gaps both in predicting environmental concentrations from indirect sources of release and its long-term environmental effects. The latter point is considered a critical data gap as aquatic organisms are expected to have long-term exposure to PFHxA due to its persistence in the water compartment.; PFHxA is already wide-spread in surface waters and biota. Continuing release of PFHxA which has no known breakdown mechanism (at least in soil and water) could result in increasing environmental concentrations over time. Hence, there is potential for ecotoxicologically significant concentrations to eventually be reached following its accumulation in the environment. In this eventuality, precursors of PFHxA such as the notified polymer cannot be recalled after release and are a potential source of PFHxA in the environment even long after their use ceases. Thus, use and disposal of the notified polymer increases the environmental risk profile of PFHxA. The notified polymer also contains impurities which are assumed to degrade to form PFHxA and longer chain perfluorocarboxylic acids. Therefore, considering the dispersive use pattern of the notified polymer, it is recommended to reduce the impurities in the notified polymer that breakdown to form PFHxA and longer chain perfluorocarboxylic acids, to the extent possible.; However, degradants of the notified polymer, along with associated impurities and residual monomers of the notified polymer, are potential precursors of the very persistent chemical, perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA). The assessed use pattern of the notified polymer does not control the release of breakdown products into the environment during use and after disposal and there are no adequate long-term environmental effects data for PFHxA. Therefore, the long-term environmental implications are unknown. Consequently, the long-term risk cannot be quantified for the notified polymer and its degradation products. In order to inform a more conclusive assessment of long-term environmental risks, further data should be generated. This may include data on longer-term environmental effects, as well as partitioning behaviour and characterisation of the degradation products, for the notified polymer and/or poly- and perfluoroalkyl degradation products (including PFHxA).; The assumed major degradation product, PFHxA, is environmentally persistent and has potential to be globally distributed. However, the ecotoxicological profile and bioaccumulation potential of PFHxA is considered to be less problematic when compared with long chain (C8 and above) perfluoroalkyl acids that PFHxA is expected to replace. Nonetheless, the introduction and use of chemicals that degrade to release PFHxA and other very persistent poly- and perfluoroalkyl compounds should be considered a short-term measure until suitable alternatives, with less persistent chemistry, are identified.; In order to limit the extent of direct release of potential PFHxA and long chain perfluorocarboxylic acid precursors to the environment, it is recommended that control measures be implemented to minimise the residual; weight percentage of unreacted polyfluoroalkyl monomer constituents and impurities in the notified polymer to the extent practicable. Where possible, the total weight of residual monomers and impurities in the notified polymer containing polyfluoroalkyl functionality should not exceed the levels attainable utilising international best practice. It is recommended that the levels remain within this range and are further reduced using available technological advances, to the extent practicable.; APPENDIX D: TOXICOLOGY OF PERFLUOROHEXANOIC ACID (PFHXA); AGC Chemicals (2010) A 24-month Oral (Gavage) Combined Chronic Toxicity/Carcinogenicity Study of Perfluorohexanoic Acid (PFHxA) in Rats (Study no.

LTD1539,"The notified polymer is intended to be introduced in order to phase out the use of a partially fluorinated polymer containing fluorinated carbon chain lengths > 6 in various proportions (ie. existing polymer). The use categories of the notified polymer are identical to those of the existing polymer it replaces, as outlined below. The proportion of the introduction volume of notified polymer for each use is also noted.","However, the notified polymer is a potential precursor for perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) in the environment, and PFHxA is persistent in the environment. Due to the environmental distribution of PFHxA resulting from the use pattern of the notified polymer, secondary human exposure to PFHxA via the environment may occur. The notified polymer is replacing a long chain polyfluoroalkylpolymer, the latter of which will result in secondary human exposures to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and longer chain perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs). PFOA and longer chain PFCAs are more hazardous to human health and have higher bioaccumulation potential, compared to PFHxA. The overall human health risk posed by the notified polymer is less than that of the substance it replaces.; However, degradants of the notified polymer, along with associated impurities and residual monomers of the notified polymer, are potential precursors of the very persistent chemical, perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA). The assessed use pattern of the notified polymer does not control the release of breakdown products into the environment during use and after disposal and the long-term environmental risk profile of PFHxA is currently unknown. Consequently, the long-term risk profile for the notified polymer and its degradation products is unknown. This situation may change if further data on the environmental behaviour of the notified polymer and its poly- and perfluoroalkyl degradation products (including PFHxA) were to become available.; The notified polymer is a potential precursor for PFHxA in the environment. PFHxA is an environmentally persistent chemical that has potential to be globally distributed. However, the ecotoxicological profile and bioaccumulation potential of PFHxA is considered to be less problematic when compared with long chain (C8 and above) perfluorocarboxylic acids that PFHxA is expected to replace, noting that current evidence suggests that PFHxA is not bioaccumulative in aquatic ecosystems. Nonetheless, the introduction and use of chemicals that degrade to release PFHxA and other very persistent poly- and perfluoroalkyl compounds should be considered a short-term measure until suitable alternatives, with less persistent chemistry, are identified.; The hydrolysis results of Analogue 1 (t1/2 > 1 year at 25 ºC, pH 4 to 9) indicate that the notified polymer is expected to be hydrolytically stable under environmental conditions. Analogue 1 and the notified polymer contain similar functional groups and are expected to have similar chemical-physical properties. Therefore, the analogue data is expected to be representative of the notified polymer for its hydrolysis profile. Investigations of the biodegradation potential of fluoroacrylate polymer and fluorotelomer-based urethane polymer in aerobic soils (Russell et al., 2008; Russell et al., 2010; Washington et al., 2009) indicate very limited degradation of the fluorinated polymers. Biodegradation of the backbone of the notified polymer is expected to occur slowly under environmental conditions due to its high molecular weight. Thus, the notified polymer is considered to be persistent in the soil and water compartments.; In surface waters, agricultural soils and landfill, the notified polymer is expected to eventually degrade to form water, oxides of carbon and nitrogen and degradation products containing polyfluoroalkyl functionality. The expected initial polyfluoroalkyl degradation products are assumed to undergo further degradation to form, among other compounds, the very persistent perfluorocarboxylic acid degradation product, PFHxA. It is noted that some volatile degradation intermediates have the potential to undergo long range atmospheric transport and thus may result in translocation of PFHxA in the environment. The notified polymer also contains; PFHxA is expected to be recalcitrant in the environment, and potentially undergo long range transport while mainly staying in the water column. In water, it is expected to be very persistent and will not hydrolyse, photolyse or biodegrade.; PEC for PFHxA and long chain perfluoroalkyl substances The notified polymer is assumed to degrade and ultimately form the persistent degradant, PFHxA. However, the yield and rate of conversion of the notified polymer to PFHxA has not been established. Environmental monitoring data shows that both PFHxA and PFOA are widely found in the environment, particularly in fresh water close to industrial sources, but also in some biota. Water appears to be the main compartment where PFHxA is found. High measured concentrations of both PFHxA and PFOA in surface waters in Germany have been associated with the legal application of waste materials to agricultural soils (Skutlarek et al., 2006) indicating that these chemicals have the potential to enter the aquatic compartment following initial release into the soil compartment.; By reducing the presence of residual poly- and perfluoroalkyl monomers and impurities in polymers, it is expected that indirect releases from the degradation of polyfluoroalkyl substances will become a significant source of persistent poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances in the environment in the future. PFHxA is already being detected in the environment and, as the long chain poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances are phased out in preference for short-chain polyfluoroalkyl chemistry containing a six-carbon perfluorohexyl moiety, the environmental levels of PFHxA are expected to increase.; Perfluoroalkyl substances are expected to be very persistent in the environment but PFHxA is considered to have low potential for bioaccumulation. There is limited evidence in the published literature of PFHxA toxicity to aquatic organisms on an acute basis, although it is reported to be toxic to marine algae.

Due to the environmental distribution of PFHxA resulting from the use pattern of the notified polymer, secondary human exposure to PFHxA via the environment may occur. The notified polymer is replacing a long chain polyfluoroalkylpolymer, the latter of which will result in secondary human exposures to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and longer chain perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs). PFOA and longer chain PFCAs are more hazardous to human health and have higher bioaccumulation potential, compared to PFHxA. The overall human health risk posed by the notified polymer is less than that of the substance it replaces.; However, degradants of the notified polymer, along with associated impurities and residual monomers of the notified polymer, are potential precursors of the very persistent chemical, perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA). The assessed use pattern of the notified polymer does not control the release of breakdown products into the environment during use and after disposal and the long-term environmental risk profile of PFHxA is currently unknown. Consequently, the long-term risk profile for the notified polymer and its degradation products is unknown. This situation may change if further data on the environmental behaviour of the notified polymer and its poly- and perfluoroalkyl degradation products (including PFHxA) were to become available.; The notified polymer is a potential precursor for PFHxA in the environment. PFHxA is an environmentally persistent chemical that has potential to be globally distributed. However, the ecotoxicological profile and bioaccumulation potential of PFHxA is considered to be less problematic when compared with long chain (C8 and above) perfluorocarboxylic acids that PFHxA is expected to replace, noting that current evidence suggests that PFHxA is not bioaccumulative in aquatic ecosystems. Nonetheless, the introduction and use of chemicals that degrade to release PFHxA and other very persistent poly- and perfluoroalkyl compounds should be considered a short-term measure until suitable alternatives, with less persistent chemistry, are identified.; • The notified polymer should only be introduced as part of a strategy to phase out the use of long chain perfluoroalkyl chemicals.; • The notifier should seek ways to minimise the level of residual polyfluoroalkyl monomers and impurities in the notified polymer. Such levels should be as low as practicable: where possible, the total weight of these constituents should not exceed the levels attainable utilising international best practice.; • If the notified polymer or products containing the notified polymer cannot feasibly be disposed using a technique that will destroy or irreversibly transform the perfluoroalkyl components of the notified polymer, disposal should be to landfill.; − additional information has become available to the person as to an adverse effect of the polyfluoroalkyl degradation products of the notified polymer (such as perfluorohexanoic acid);; − additional information has become available to the person as to the environmental fate of the polymer or its polyfluoroalkyl degradation products (such as perfluorohexanoic acid) in relation to degradation or partitioning behaviour, including during water treatment processes;; The notified polymer contains a polyfluoroalkyl carbon side chain with six perfluorinated carbons.; The notified polymer is a potential precursor for PFHxA in the environment (PFHxA: perfluorohexanoic acid – CAS name: Hexanoic acid, 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,6-undecafluoro-; CAS No. 307-24-4).; absorption based on the presence of perfluoroalkyl functionalities that have hydro/lipophobic tendencies.; The notified polymer may undergo slow degradation in the environment. As such, most potential exposure to workers and the public is expected to be to the notified polymer itself, rather than to its degradation products. Exposure to the residual polyfluoroalkyl starting constituents and/or impurities of the notified polymer (discrete polyfluoroalkyl chemicals containing perfluoroalkyl carbon chain lengths ranging from four to ten) is also possible. Such exposure is limited by the relatively low concentration of polyfluoroalkyl impurities in the notified polymer in imported products (up to 0.1%) or in end-use products (up to 0.005%).; Toxicology of break down products The notified polymer contains perfluoroalkyl side-chains that are potential precursors for PFHxA in the environment (PFHxA; CAS No. 307-24-4). PFHxA is a perfluorocarboxylic acid consisting of 5 perfluorinated carbons (a short chain perfluorinated chemical). The polymer that is proposed for replacement by the notified polymer is expected to break down to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA; CAS No. 335-67-1) (consisting of 7 perfluorinated carbons) and other per- and polyfluorocarboxylic substances with longer perfluoroalkyl carbon chain lengths. The toxicokinetic and toxicological properties of the long chain breakdown products are generally less favourable compared to the short chain breakdown products, with properties becoming less favourable with increasing perfluoroalkyl carbon chain length. In addition, it has been established that the bioaccumulation potential of perfluorocarboxylic acids increases with perfluoroalkyl carbon chain length (Conder et al., 2008; Giesy et al., 2010).; A review of the literature indicates that PFHxA has a less hazardous human health profile, compared to PFOA (refer to Appendix C for details). It is therefore inferred that the human health hazards associated with the expected breakdown product of the notified polymer (PFHxA) are likely to be similar or less than the human health hazards associated with the expected breakdown products (PFOA and longer chain perfluorocarboxylic acids) of many per- and polyfluoroalkyl chemicals currently on the market and that are intended for replacement by the notified polymer.; Workers may also be exposed to perfluoroalkyl starting constituents and/or impurities of the notified polymer at relatively low concentrations during reformulation and end use operations. It is expected that the engineering controls and personal protective equipment utilised during these operations (as outlined above) will act to mitigate any risk associated with such exposure.; Paint products containing the notified polymer (up to 1% concentration) and relatively low levels of perfluoroalkyl impurities (< 0.2%) will be available to the public. Paint products will be applied by brush and roller. Public exposure is likely to be less frequent than professional exposure. The risk to public health from use of paints containing the notified polymer is not considered to be unreasonable based on the low concentration (up to 1%) of the polymer in final paint products, and the expected pattern of exposure.; The public may be exposed indirectly to PFHxA formed by degradation of the notified polymer in the environment. Such exposure may increase over time due to the persistence of PFHxA in the environment. A quantitative risk assessment for this exposure was not conducted. However, the available data indicates that PFHxA has a more favourable toxicological profile and bioaccumulation potential than the long chain perfluoroalkyl substances that are the ultimate break down products of the majority of perfluoroalkyl polymers currently in Australian commerce (such as PFOA). In particular, it is noted that the polymer being replaced contains perfluoroalkyl carbon chain lengths > 6. It is concluded that the risks to human health from indirect exposure to breakdown products of perfluoroalkyl substances will decrease following introduction of the notified polymer, on the basis that the notified polymer is intended to replace a currently available long chain perfluoroalkyl polymer.; Some of the notified polymer is expected to be disposed of to sewers and waste treatment plants as a result of reformulation, use and disposal. Non-ionic polymers with a molecular weight of more than 1000 Da are generally considered to be efficiently removed in treatment plants processes through adsorption to sludge. Predictions of the environmental partitioning behaviour of polyfluoroalkyl compounds such as the notified polymer remain uncertain based on current knowledge because of limited data and their unique properties. In particular, the usual predictive models for partitioning during sewage treatment are inapplicable for chemicals containing perfluoroalkyl functionality as they assume lipophilicity for hydrophobic functionality, whereas the perfluoroalkyl functionality is both hydrophobic and lipophobic. The assumption that surface activity and/or high molecular weight results in efficient removal by sorption to sludge during conventional wastewater treatment has not been verified by supporting data for this class of polymer. Thus, noting its potential of being both hydrophobic and lipophobic, the notified polymer, its degradation products and any associated impurities/residual monomers of poly- or perfluoroalkyl compounds, may remain in the aqueous phase following wastewater treatment. As such, the notified polymer, its degradation products and the poly- or perfluoroalkyl impurities/residual monomers in wastewater have the potential to be released in effluent directly to surface waters or reused in the irrigation of agricultural soils throughout Australia.; In surface waters, agricultural soils and landfill, the notified polymer is expected to eventually degrade to form water, oxides of carbon and nitrogen and degradation products containing polyfluoroalkyl functionality. The expected initial polyfluoroalkyl degradation products are assumed to undergo further degradation to form, among other compounds, the very persistent perfluorocarboxylic acid degradation product, PFHxA. It is noted that some volatile degradation intermediates have the potential to undergo long range atmospheric transport and thus may result in translocation of PFHxA in the environment. The notified polymer also contains; relatively low levels of impurities that may degrade to form perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and other long-chain perfluorocarboxylic acids.; High-temperature incineration is the preferred method of disposal of poly- and perfluoroalkyl compounds due to the environmental persistence characteristics, when it results in mineralisation of the perfluoroalkyl functionality to oxides of carbon and hydrofluoric acid. Incomplete combustion of perfluoroalkyl functionality may produce an array of partially oxidised fluorocompounds. Therefore, disposal of the notified polymer and its degradation products by incineration at lower temperatures should only take place at facilities that completely combust the perfluoroalkyl functionality and have adequate measures in place to control release of hydrofluoric acid.; Due to its high molecular weight which limits the ability to cross biological membranes, the notified polymer is not expected to bioaccumulate. The available laboratory (Higgins et al., 2007; Martin et al., 2003ab; Woodcroft et al., 2010) and field (Falandysz et al., 2006; Falandysz et al., 2007, Furdui et al., 2007) evidence indicates that PFHxA is expected to be less bioaccumulative than PFOA and other long chain perfluoroalkylated compounds, which PFHxA- chemistry is replacing (although PFHxA and PFOA are not considered bioaccumulative). However, both are bioavailable and can be detected in wildlife as demonstrated by monitoring studies (Kumar et al., 2009; Ye et al., 2008a; Ye et al., 2008b; Wang et al., 2008). In general, the available evidence indicates that the bioaccumulation potential of perfluoroalkyl compounds is correlated with increasing carbon chain length (Giesy et al., 2010). Therefore, PFHxA has a lower bioaccumulation potential than PFOA and other long chain perfluoroalkyl substances.; PEC for PFHxA and long chain perfluoroalkyl substances The notified polymer is assumed to degrade and ultimately form the persistent degradant, PFHxA. However, the yield and rate of conversion of the notified polymer to PFHxA has not been established. Environmental monitoring data shows that both PFHxA and PFOA are widely found in the environment, particularly in fresh water close to industrial sources, but also in some biota. Water appears to be the main compartment where PFHxA is found. High measured concentrations of both PFHxA and PFOA in surface waters in Germany have been associated with the legal application of waste materials to agricultural soils (Skutlarek et al., 2006) indicating that these chemicals have the potential to enter the aquatic compartment following initial release into the soil compartment.; PFHxA and other poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances have also been found in landfill leachate, with concentrations of PFHxA ranging from 270 – 790 ng/L (Huset et al., 2011).  As landfills are reservoirs of solid waste, and receive waste water treatment plant sludge, which may contain poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances, landfills have the potential to continue to release PFHxA and homologues well into the future.; Historically, release of poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances into the environment has been linked to direct releases of low molecular weight poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances, such as poly- and perfluoroalkyl monomers during polymer manufacture and reformulation processes, rather than breakdown of the polymers themselves. In order to limit the extent of direct release of potential PFHxA precursors to the environment, it is recommended that control measures be implemented to minimise the residual weight percentage of unreacted poly- and perfluoroalkyl monomer constituents and impurities in the notified polymer to the extent practicable. Zhao et al. (2013) report that fluorotelomer alcohol (FTOH) residual raw material content in FTOH-based polymeric products is generally less than 0.1%. Efforts have also been made globally to control releases of perfluoroalkyl acids, such as PFOA and potential precursors, such as by reducing the presence of residual poly- and perfluoroalkyl monomers and impurities in polymers. It is recommended that the total weight of residual monomers and impurities in the notified polymer containing polyfluoroalkyl functionality should not exceed the levels attainable utilising international best practice and the levels are further reduced using available technological advances, to the extent practicable.; By reducing the presence of residual poly- and perfluoroalkyl monomers and impurities in polymers, it is expected that indirect releases from the degradation of polyfluoroalkyl substances will become a significant source of persistent poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances in the environment in the future. PFHxA is already being detected in the environment and, as the long chain poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances are phased out in preference for short-chain polyfluoroalkyl chemistry containing a six-carbon perfluorohexyl moiety, the environmental levels of PFHxA are expected to increase.; Half-lives of polyfluoroalkyl polymers in aerobic soil have been found to be indeterminate with calculated half-lives ranging from decades to millennia (Russell et al., 2008; Russell et al., 2010; Washington et al, 2009). The half-lives of PFHxA in various environmental media are also unknown and its partitioning behaviour is uncertain. Further, degradation products of the notified polymer are unknown. Therefore, a PEC for indirect releases of PFHxA arising from proposed use and disposal of the notified polymer in Australia cannot be determined.; Effects of PFHxA and long chain perfluorocarboxylic acids  There are only limited available toxicity data for PFHxA to organisms, and these are limited to aquatic organisms. Based on the available literature, the most sensitive trophic level is algae. Latala et al. (2009) reported the 72-hour median effect concentrations (72 h EC50) for three marine species as follows: 1.0 mg/L for blue green algae (Geitlerinema amphibium); 1.4 mg/L for diatom (Skeletonema marinoi); and, 4.0 mg/L for green algae (Chlorella vulgaris). The data indicates that PFHxA is toxic to algae on an acute basis. The study also investigated the toxicity of PFOA to the three marine species: 0.25 mg/L for blue green algae; 0.37 mg/L for diatom; and, 0.98 mg/L for green algae. The data indicates that PFOA is very toxic to algae on an acute basis and demonstrate decreased toxicity of PFHxA compared with PFOA to the three species tested.; Giesy et al. (2010) reported the relationship between increasing carbon chain length and increasing toxicity. Therefore, PFHxA is expected to have a less problematic ecotoxicological profile than PFOA and other long chain perfluorocarboxylic acids it is expected to replace. Long-term effects data that reflect or model the periods over which perfluorocarboxylic acids are present in the environment are not available for PFHxA or long chain perfluorocarboxylic acids. Therefore, the long-term hazard to aquatic organisms has not been adequately established and is unknown.; The lower limit of the endpoint determined for fish on Analogue 2 (96 h LC50 > 50 mg/L) was used to calculate the Predicted No-Effect Concentration (PNEC) as it represents the most sensitive ecotoxicological endpoint. Although only acute endpoints for daphnia are available for the notified polymer, the analogue data for fish is expected to be representative of the notified polymer based on their structure similarity. Furthermore, the available measured ecotoxicity endpoints for other polyfluoroalkylated polymers indicate that daphnia and fish represent the more sensitive species. Therefore, an assessment factor of 100 was used for the PNEC calculation.; Perfluoroalkyl substances are expected to be very persistent in the environment but PFHxA is considered to have low potential for bioaccumulation. There is limited evidence in the published literature of PFHxA toxicity to aquatic organisms on an acute basis, although it is reported to be toxic to marine algae. There is no available data on the long-term aquatic effects of PFHxA.; The main environmental risks associated with polyfluoroalkyl polymers relate to the release of perfluoroalkyl degradation products such as PFHxA. However, it is not possible to quantify the long-term risks of PFHxA to the environment due to knowledge gaps both in predicting environmental concentrations from indirect sources of; However, degradants of the notified polymer, along with associated impurities and residual monomers of the notified polymer, are potential precursors of the very persistent chemical, perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA). The assessed use pattern of the notified polymer does not control the release of breakdown products into the environment during use and after disposal and the long-term environmental risk profile of PFHxA is currently unknown. Consequently, the long-term risk profile of the notified polymer and its degradation products is unknown. This situation may change if further data on the environmental behaviour of the notified polymer and its poly- and perfluoroalkylated degradation products (including PFHxA) were to become available.; The assumed major degradation product, PFHxA, is environmentally persistent and has potential to be globally distributed.

Where possible, the total weight of residual monomers and impurities in the notified polymer containing polyfluoroalkyl functionality should not exceed the levels attainable utilising international best practice. It is recommended that the levels remain within this range and are further reduced using available technological advances, to the extent practicable.; APPENDIX E: TOXICOLOGY OF PERFLUOROHEXANOIC ACID (PFHXA); AGC Chemicals (2010) A 24-month oral (gavage) combined chronic toxicity/carcinogenicity study of perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) in rats (Study no.

Efforts have also been made globally to control releases of perfluoroalkyl acids, such as PFOA and potential precursors, such as by reducing the presence of residual poly- and perfluoroalkyl monomers and impurities in polymers. It is recommended that the total weight of residual monomers and impurities in the notified polymer containing polyfluoroalkyl functionality should not exceed the levels attainable utilising international best practice and the levels are further reduced using available technological advances, to the extent practicable.; PFHxA is already wide-spread in surface waters and biota. Continuing release of PFHxA which has no known breakdown mechanism (at least in soil and water) could result in increasing environmental concentrations over time. Hence, there is potential for ecotoxicologically significant concentrations to eventually be reached following its accumulation in the environment. In this eventuality, precursors of PFHxA such as the notified polymer cannot be recalled after release and are a potential source of PFHxA in the environment even long after their use ceases. Thus, use and disposal of the notified polymer increases the environmental risk profile of PFHxA. The notified polymer also contains impurities which are assumed to degrade to form PFHxA and longer chain perfluorinated acids. Therefore, considering the dispersive use pattern of the notified polymer, it is recommended to restrict the impurities in the notified polymer that breakdown to form PFHxA and longer chain perfluorinated acids, to the extent possible.; In order to limit the extent of direct release of potential PFHxA and long chain perfluorocarboxylic acid precursors to the environment, it is recommended that control measures be implemented to minimise the residual weight percentage of unreacted polyfluoroalkyl monomer constituents and impurities in the notified polymer to the extent practicable.

LTD1629,"The notified polymer will be used as a direct replacement of a partially fluorinated polymer containing fluorinated carbon chain lengths of ≥ 6 in various proportions. The use categories of the notified polymer are identical to those of the existing polymer it replaces, as outlined below.","However, the notified polymer is a potential precursor for perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS) in the environment, and PFBS is persistent in the environment. Due to the environmental distribution of PFBS resulting from the use pattern of the notified polymer, secondary human exposure to PFBS via the environment may occur. The notified polymer is replacing a long-chain polyfluoroalkyl polymer, which will result in secondary human exposures to other polyfluoroalkyl chemicals, including perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and other long chain perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs). PFOA and longer chain PFCAs are more hazardous to human health and have higher bioaccumulation potential, compared to PFBS. The overall human health risk posed by the notified polymer is less than that of the substance it replaces.; However, degradants of the notified polymer, along with associated impurities and residual monomers of the notified polymer, are potential precursors of the persistent chemical, perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS). The assessed use pattern of the notified polymer does not control the release of breakdown products into the environment after disposal and the long-term environmental risk profile of PFBS is currently unknown. Consequently, the long-term risk profile for the notified polymer and its degradation products are unknown.; The notified polymer is a potential precursor for PFBS in the environment. PFBS is an environmentally persistent chemical that has potential to be globally distributed. However, the ecotoxicological profile and bioaccumulation potential of PFBS is considered to be less problematic when compared with long chain (C8 and above) perfluorocarboxylic acids that PFBS is expected to replace, noting that current evidence suggests PFBS is not bioaccumulative in aquatic ecosystems. Nonetheless, the introduction and use of chemicals that degrade to release PFBS and other very persistent poly- and perfluoroalkyl compounds, should be considered a short-term measure until suitable alternatives, with less persistent chemistry, are identified.; The notified polymer is not expected to rapidly hydrolyse under environmental conditions. The calculated hydrolysis half-life of an analogue polymer indicates that the half-life is potentially 48 years under environmental conditions (pH 7) with half-lives potentially reduced under more extreme conditions. Investigations submitted by the notifier on the biodegradation potential of PFBS-based urethane and acrylate polymers, such as the notified polymer, indicate similar primary degradation pathways as standard hydrocarbon based polymers. However, biodegradation of the backbone of the notified polymer is expected to occur slowly under environmental conditions due to its high molecular weight. PFBS is expected to be a product of biodegradation of the notified polymer. Studies indicate that the PFBS-based urethane and acrylate polymers also have the potential to undergo weathering via photolysis in the environment. Ultimately, photolysis pathways of these polymers have the potential to form PFBS, perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) and nonafluorobutane with half-lives of the polymer being less than two years according to information submitted by the notifier. Thus, the notified polymer is expected to be persistent with the potential to photolyse under environmental conditions.; In surface waters, agricultural soils and landfill, the notified polymer is expected to degrade over extended periods of time to form water, oxides of carbon and nitrogen, and degradation products containing poly- and perfluoalkyl functionality. The expected initial polyfluoroalkyl degradation products are assumed to undergo further degradation to form, among other compounds, the very persistent perfluoroalkyl degradation product of the notified polymer, PFBS. It is noted that some volatile degradation intermediates have the potential to undergo long range atmospheric transport and thus may result in translocation of PFBS in the environment.; PFBS is expected to be recalcitrant in the environment, and potentially undergo long-range transport while mainly staying in the water column (NICNAS 2005). The susceptibility of PFBS for long-range transport is increased compared to long chain perfluoroalkyl compounds, such as perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), because its degradation precursors are expected to be more volatile and more likely to enter the atmospheric compartment (NICNAS 2005). PFBS is expected to be very persistent and has limited potential to hydrolyse, photolyse or biodegrade (NICNAS 2005). The increased potential for long-range transport is of concern for PFBS-based compounds as they are increasingly used as replacements for long chain perfluoroalkyl compounds such as those based on PFOA. Increasingly higher use of PFBS-based compounds may result in the accumulation of PFBS in regions where PFBS or PFBS-based compounds have not been intentionally released, including in pristine environments.; The notified polymer is assumed to degrade and ultimately form the persistent degradant, PFBS, which is likely to mostly partition to the aqueous compartment (NICNAS 2005). Historically, release of perfluoroalkyl contaminants into the environment has been linked to direct releases of low molecular weight poly- and perfluoroalkyl chemicals, such as poly- and perfluoroalkyl monomers during polymer manufacture and reformulation processes, rather than breakdown of the polymers themselves.; Efforts have been made globally to control releases of perfluoroalkyl contaminants, such as by reducing the presence of residual polyfluoroalkyl monomers and impurities in polymers. Thus, it is expected that indirect releases from the degradation of polyfluoroalkyl polymers will become a significant source of persistent perfluoroalkyl compounds in the environment in the future. Compared to long chain perfluoroalkyl compounds, there has been limited detection of PFBS in the environment. However, as the long chain perfluoroalkyl compounds are phased out in preference for short-chain polyfluoroalkyl chemistry containing four-carbon perfluorobutyl moieties, the environmental levels of PFBS may increase.; The persistent degradation product, PFBS, is not considered to be toxic to aquatic organisms (NICNAS 2005). The most sensitive aquatic species was found to be the mysid shrimp, with a 96-hour median effective concentration (EC50) of 372 mg/L. All other aquatic organisms tested (fish, daphnids, alga and sewage microorganisms) were reported to have EC50s >1000 mg/L (NICNAS 2005). Therefore, PFBS is not expected to be harmful to aquatic organisms on a short-term basis. With respect to the long-term hazard to the environment, traditional long-term studies do not adequately represent the potential hazard for very persistent compounds. Test studies are not available for PFBS for periods exceeding 21 days (Daphnia: NOEC (21 d) = 502 mg/L). As PFBS is very persistent and there is a potential for it to accumulate in the environment, aquatic organisms will be exposed to PFBS for periods longer than 21 days. Therefore, the long-term hazard to aquatic organisms has not been fully characterised.; Perfluoroalkyl compounds are expected to be very persistent in the environment (for example, PFOA: t½ (hydrolysis) > 200 years; US EPA 2002) but PFBS is considered to have low potential for bioaccumulation. PFBS is not considered to be harmful to aquatic organisms at concentrations less than 372 mg/L on an acute basis. There is no available data on the long-term aquatic effects of PFBS beyond the limits of traditional long-term ecotoxicity tests.; However, degradants of the notified polymer, along with associated impurities and residual monomers of the notified polymer, are potential precursors of the persistent chemical, perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS).

Due to the environmental distribution of PFBS resulting from the use pattern of the notified polymer, secondary human exposure to PFBS via the environment may occur. The notified polymer is replacing a long-chain polyfluoroalkyl polymer, which will result in secondary human exposures to other polyfluoroalkyl chemicals, including perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and other long chain perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs). PFOA and longer chain PFCAs are more hazardous to human health and have higher bioaccumulation potential, compared to PFBS. The overall human health risk posed by the notified polymer is less than that of the substance it replaces.; However, degradants of the notified polymer, along with associated impurities and residual monomers of the notified polymer, are potential precursors of the persistent chemical, perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS). The assessed use pattern of the notified polymer does not control the release of breakdown products into the environment after disposal and the long-term environmental risk profile of PFBS is currently unknown. Consequently, the long-term risk profile for the notified polymer and its degradation products are unknown.; The notified polymer is a potential precursor for PFBS in the environment. PFBS is an environmentally persistent chemical that has potential to be globally distributed. However, the ecotoxicological profile and bioaccumulation potential of PFBS is considered to be less problematic when compared with long chain (C8 and above) perfluorocarboxylic acids that PFBS is expected to replace, noting that current evidence suggests PFBS is not bioaccumulative in aquatic ecosystems. Nonetheless, the introduction and use of chemicals that degrade to release PFBS and other very persistent poly- and perfluoroalkyl compounds, should be considered a short-term measure until suitable alternatives, with less persistent chemistry, are identified.; • The notified polymer should only be introduced as part of a strategy to phase out the use of long chain perfluoroalkyl chemicals.; • The notifier should seek ways to minimise the level of residual polyfluoroalkyl monomers and impurities in the notified polymer. Such levels should be as low as practicable: where possible, the total weight of these constituents should not exceed the levels attainable utilising international best practice.; − additional information has become available to the person as to an adverse effect of the polyfluoroalkyl degradation products of the notified polymer (such as perfluorobutanesulfonic acid);; − additional information has become available to the person as to the environmental fate of the polymer or its polyfluoroalkyl degradation products (such as perfluorobutanesulfonic acid) in relation to degradation or partitioning behaviour, including during water treatment processes;; The notified polymer is a potential precursor for perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS) in the environment (CAS name for PFBS when present as the acid: 1-Butanesulfonic acid, 1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,4-nonafluoro-; CAS No.: 375-73-5).; Adsorption/Desorption Not determined Generally, non-ionic polymers of high molecular weight are expected to adsorb to soil, sediments and sludge. However, the notified polymer may have low absorption based on the presence of perfluoroalkyl functionalities that have hydro/lipophobic tendencies.; The notified polymer may undergo slow degradation in the environment. As such, most potential exposure to workers and the public is expected to be to the notified polymer itself, rather than to its degradation products. Exposure to the residual polyfluoroalkyl starting constituents and/or impurities of the notified polymer (polyfluoroalkyl chemicals containing perfluoroalkyl carbon chain lengths of four) is also possible. Such exposure is limited by the relatively low concentration of polyfluoroalkyl impurities in the notified polymer in the imported and end use products.; Toxicology of break down products The notified polymer contains perfluoroalkyl side-chains that are potential precursors of PFBS in the environment. PFBS is a perfluorosulfonic acid consisting of 4 perfluorinated carbons (a short-chain perfluorinated chemical). The polymer that is proposed for replacement by the notified polymer is expected to degrade to per- and polyfluorocarboxylic substances with a range of perfluoroalkyl carbon chain lengths. The main concern is for the long chain polyfluoroalkyl degradation products, including perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA; CAS No. 335-67-1) (consisting of 7 perfluorinated carbons) and other longer chain compounds. The toxicokinetic and toxicological properties of the long chain break down products are generally less favourable compared to the short chain break down products, with properties becoming less favourable with increasing perfluoroalkyl carbon chain length. In addition, it has been established that the bioaccumulation potential of perfluorocarboxylic acids increases with perfluoroalkyl carbon chain length (Conder, 2008; Giesy 2010).; It is concluded that PFBS has a less hazardous human health profile compared to PFOA. It is therefore inferred that the human health hazards associated with the expected breakdown product of the notified polymer (PFBS) are likely to be less than the human health hazards associated with many of the expected breakdown products (PFOA and longer chain perfluorocarboxylic acids) of the perfluoroalkyl chemical currently on the market and that is intended for replacement by the notified polymer.; Systemic exposure of workers to break down products is not expected based on the stability of the notified polymer.  Workers may also be exposed to perfluoroalkyl starting constituents and/or impurities of the notified polymer at relatively low concentrations. It is expected that the engineering controls and personal protective equipment utilised during these operations (as outlined above) will act to mitigate any risk associated with such exposure.; Stone and tile products containing the notified polymer (up to 8% concentration) and perfluoroalkyl impurities (up to 0.0048%) will be available to the public. Stone and tile products will be applied by brush, roller or mop. Public exposure is expected to be infrequent and short term. As with use by tradesmen there is expected to be negligible inhalation exposure. The expected low toxicity of the notified polymer means that dermal or ocular exposure to stone and tile products containing it is not expected to lead to adverse health effects. Based on these considerations, the risk to public health from use of stone and tile products containing the notified polymer is not considered to be unreasonable. Additionally, the risk to public health from exposures to polyfluoroalkyl impurities during use of products containing the notified polymer is not considered to be unreasonable based on their low concentration (up to 0.0048%) in end-use products.; absorption is unlikely to occur. Thus the risk to public health due to long term exposure to the notified polymer from treated tiles or stone is not considered to be unreasonable. Due to the low level of perfluoroalkyl impurities present in the notified polymer, the risk to public health due to long term exposure to perfluoroalkyl impurities of the notified polymer from tiles or stone is not considered to be unreasonable.; The public may be exposed indirectly to PFBS, formed by degradation of the notified polymer in the environment.  Such exposure may increase over time due to the persistence of PFBS in the environment. A quantitative risk assessment for this exposure was not conducted. However, the available data indicates that PFBS has a more favourable toxicological profile and bioaccumulation potential than the long-chain perfluoroalkyl substances that are the ultimate break down products of the majority of perfluoroalkyl polymers currently in Australian commerce (such as PFOA). In particular, it is noted that the polymer being replaced contains perfluoroalkyl carbon chain lengths ≥ 6. It is concluded that the risks to human health from indirect exposure to breakdown products of perfluoroalkyl substances will decrease following introduction of the notified polymer, on the basis that the notified polymer is used to replace a currently available long chain perfluoroalkyl polymer.; RELEASE OF CHEMICAL FROM DISPOSAL The notified polymer applied to treated stone and tile surfaces is expected to adhere to the surface to which it has been applied. However, abrasion of the floor surface by foot traffic is expected to result in some relocation of the notified polymer. Estimates for losses due to abrasion from these uses are not available. The notified polymer that remains associated with stone and tile is expected to share the fate of articles. The majority of articles are expected to ultimately be disposed of to landfill. The notified polymer applied to surfaces may also degrade as a result of weathering upon being exposed to environmental conditions. Degradation may result in the widespread release of perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS) to surface waters, landfill and landfill leachates, soils, and other regions where release is not foreseen.; Some of the notified polymer may be released to sewer during DIY applications and improper disposal. Predictions of the environmental partitioning behaviour of poly- and perfluoroalkyl polymers, such as the notified polymer, remain uncertain based on current knowledge because of limited data and their unique properties. In particular, the usual predictive models for partitioning during sewage treatment are inapplicable for chemicals containing perfluoroalkyl functionality as they assume lipophilicity for hydrophobic functionality, whereas the perfluoroalkyl functionality is both hydrophobic and lipophobic. The assumption that surface activity and/or high molecular weight results in efficient removal by sorption to sludge during conventional wastewater treatment has not been verified by supporting data for this class of chemical. However, the notified polymer will be incorporated in a product that is expected to potentially solidify upon contact with water, increasing the likelihood that the notified polymer will be removed from the aqueous phase during sewage treatment plant (STP) processes via adsorption to sludge. Therefore, the notified polymer may potentially be present in STP effluent and biosolids that will be reused and applied to agricultural soils throughout Australia.; The notified polymer is not expected to rapidly hydrolyse under environmental conditions. The calculated hydrolysis half-life of an analogue polymer indicates that the half-life is potentially 48 years under environmental conditions (pH 7) with half-lives potentially reduced under more extreme conditions. Investigations submitted by the notifier on the biodegradation potential of PFBS-based urethane and acrylate polymers, such as the notified polymer, indicate similar primary degradation pathways as standard hydrocarbon based polymers. However, biodegradation of the backbone of the notified polymer is expected to occur slowly under environmental conditions due to its high molecular weight. PFBS is expected to be a product of biodegradation of the notified polymer. Studies indicate that the PFBS-based urethane and acrylate polymers also have the potential to undergo weathering via photolysis in the environment. Ultimately, photolysis pathways of these polymers have the potential to form PFBS, perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) and nonafluorobutane with half-lives of the polymer being less than two years according to information submitted by the notifier. Thus, the notified polymer is expected to be persistent with the potential to photolyse under environmental conditions.; In surface waters, agricultural soils and landfill, the notified polymer is expected to degrade over extended periods of time to form water, oxides of carbon and nitrogen, and degradation products containing poly- and perfluoalkyl functionality. The expected initial polyfluoroalkyl degradation products are assumed to undergo further degradation to form, among other compounds, the very persistent perfluoroalkyl degradation product of the notified polymer, PFBS. It is noted that some volatile degradation intermediates have the potential to undergo long range atmospheric transport and thus may result in translocation of PFBS in the environment.; PFBS is expected to be recalcitrant in the environment, and potentially undergo long-range transport while mainly staying in the water column (NICNAS 2005). The susceptibility of PFBS for long-range transport is increased compared to long chain perfluoroalkyl compounds, such as perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), because its degradation precursors are expected to be more volatile and more likely to enter the atmospheric compartment (NICNAS 2005). PFBS is expected to be very persistent and has limited potential to hydrolyse, photolyse or biodegrade (NICNAS 2005). The increased potential for long-range transport is of concern for PFBS-based compounds as they are increasingly used as replacements for long chain perfluoroalkyl compounds such as those based on PFOA. Increasingly higher use of PFBS-based compounds may result in the accumulation of PFBS in regions where PFBS or PFBS-based compounds have not been intentionally released, including in pristine environments.; By 2005, there was limited detection of PFBS in the environment (NICNAS 2005). However, a recent study detected PFBS in 24% of water samples taken from the Greenland Sea with concentrations ranging from < 51 to 65 pg/L (Zhao 2012). As long chain perfluoroalkyl acids are phased out in preference for short-chain polyfluoroalkyl chemistry containing a four-carbon perfluorobutyl moiety (like the notified polymer), the introduction of chemicals degrading to PFBS may lead to a measurable increase over time of the environmental levels of PFBS. The scale and time frame of such an increase, and its relevance to characterising the long term environmental risk profile of PFBS, currently remain unknown.; Due to its high molecular weight which limits the ability to cross biological membranes, the notified polymer is not expected to bioaccumulate. The available evidence indicates that the assumed major degradation product, PFBS, is expected to have a lower bioaccumulation potential than long chain perfluoroalkyl compounds (C8 and; above) as the bioaccumulation potential of perfluoroalkyl compounds is correlated with increasing carbon chain length (Giesy et al., 2010). The reported half-life of PFBS in rainbow trout was 3.3 days in a dietary accumulation study (NICNAS 2005).; High-temperature incineration is the preferred method of disposal of perfluoroalkyl compounds due to the environmental persistence characteristics, when it results in mineralisation of the perfluoroalkyl functionality to oxides of carbon and hydrofluoric acid. Incomplete combustion of perfluoroalkyl functionality may produce an array of partially oxidised fluorocompounds. Therefore, disposal of the notified polymer and its degradation products by incineration should only take place at facilities that demonstrate complete combustion of the perfluoroalkyl functionality and have adequate measures in place to control release of hydrofluoric acid.; The notified polymer is assumed to degrade and ultimately form the persistent degradant, PFBS, which is likely to mostly partition to the aqueous compartment (NICNAS 2005). Historically, release of perfluoroalkyl contaminants into the environment has been linked to direct releases of low molecular weight poly- and perfluoroalkyl chemicals, such as poly- and perfluoroalkyl monomers during polymer manufacture and reformulation processes, rather than breakdown of the polymers themselves.; In order to limit the extent of direct release of potential PFBS precursors to the environment, it is recommended that control measures be implemented to minimise the residual weight percentage of unreacted polyfluoroalkyl monomer constituents and impurities in the notified polymer to the extent practicable. Residual polyfluoroalkyl monomer and impurity levels in the notified polymer should be as low as practicable: where possible, the total weight of these constituents should not exceed the levels attainable utilising international best practice.; Efforts have been made globally to control releases of perfluoroalkyl contaminants, such as by reducing the presence of residual polyfluoroalkyl monomers and impurities in polymers. Thus, it is expected that indirect releases from the degradation of polyfluoroalkyl polymers will become a significant source of persistent perfluoroalkyl compounds in the environment in the future. Compared to long chain perfluoroalkyl compounds, there has been limited detection of PFBS in the environment. However, as the long chain perfluoroalkyl compounds are phased out in preference for short-chain polyfluoroalkyl chemistry containing four-carbon perfluorobutyl moieties, the environmental levels of PFBS may increase.; The hydrolysis half-life of the notified polymer is indicated to be approximately 48 years under environmental conditions (3M 2002) and the notified polymer may undergo photolysis with a potential half-life of less than two years, according to information provided by the notifier. However, large uncertainties remain with calculating the contribution of indirect sources to the environmental load of perfluoroalkyl compounds. These uncertainties including determination of the timeframe over which release may occur and global transport mechanisms. Therefore, a PEC for indirect releases of PFBS arising from proposed use and disposal of the notified polymer in Australia cannot be determined.; The notified polymer contains short-chain polyfluoroalkyl chemistry and consists of a four-carbon perfluorobutyl moiety. Short-chain polyfluoroalkyl chemistry is intended to replace long chain polyfluoroalkylchemistry (C8 and above). Whilst sulphonic acid moieties tend to be more toxic than the carboxylic acid of the same fluorinated carbon chain of the same length, the toxicity of perfluoroalkyl compounds increase with increasing carbon chain length (Giesy et al., 2010). As a comparison, the available data indicate that, for example, PFOA or its salts are, at most, harmful to fish with 96-hour median lethal concentrations (LC50) ranging from 70 to 1550 mg/L (US FDA, 2009; ECHC, 2012). 48-Hour median effect concentrations (EC50) based on immobilisation for Daphnia magna ranged from 34 to 1200 mg/L (ECHC, 2012), indicating that PFOA and its salts may be considered toxic to aquatic invertebrates on an acute basis. Reproduction studies on Daphnia over 21 days, resulted in NOECs ranging from 13 to 89 mg/L. 96-Hour NOECs, based on growth rate, from algal toxicity studies ranged from 1.0 to 500 mg/L (ECHC, 2012). Therefore, PFBS is expected to have a less problematic ecotoxicological profile than the long chain perfluoroalkyl acids it is expected to replace.; Perfluoroalkyl compounds are expected to be very persistent in the environment (for example, PFOA: t½ (hydrolysis) > 200 years; US EPA 2002) but PFBS is considered to have low potential for bioaccumulation. PFBS is not considered to be harmful to aquatic organisms at concentrations less than 372 mg/L on an acute basis. There is no available data on the long-term aquatic effects of PFBS beyond the limits of traditional long-term ecotoxicity tests.; The main environmental risks associated with polyfluoroalkyl polymers relate to the release of poly- and perfluoroalkyl degradation products, such as PFBS. However, it is not possible to quantify the long-term risks of PFBS to the environment due to knowledge gaps both in predicting environmental concentrations from indirect sources of release and the uncertainty surrounding long-term environmental effects. To date, the available data on environmental concentrations of PFBS indicate a low risk of environmental toxicity. However, the long-term environmental risk profile of PFBS is currently unknown, and further long term research should ideally be undertaken to characterise this risk.; There has been limited detection of PFBS in the environment. However, as the long chain perfluoroalkyl compounds are phased out in preference for short-chain polyfluoroalkyl chemistry containing four-carbon perfluorobutyl moieties, the environmental levels of PFBS are expected to increase. Continuing release of PFBS is expected to result in increasing environmental concentrations over time. Hence, there is potential for ecotoxicologically significant concentrations to eventually be reached following its accumulation in the environment over significant periods of time. In this eventuality, precursors of PFBS such as the notified polymer cannot be recalled after release and are a potential source of PFBS in the environment even long after their use ceases. Thus, use and disposal of the notified polymer increases the environmental risk profile of PFBS over time. Considering the potential for widespread release of PFBS from unreacted monomers in polymeric material, it is recommended to reduce the levels of impurities in the notified polymer, to the extent practicable.; However, degradants of the notified polymer, along with associated impurities and residual monomers of the notified polymer, are potential precursors of the persistent chemical, perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS).

Like other perfluorinated acids, TFA is expected to be resistant to biotic and abiotic degradation and thus is considered very persistent in the aquatic environment.; The atmospheric degradation of the notified chemical is expected to result in rainout of the persistent degradant, TFA, into the aquatic compartment. Due to the long atmospheric lifetime of the notified chemical (about two weeks), TFA may be deposited in precipitation away from the site of release. TFA is ubiquitous in the aquatic environment and has been found at up to 0.2 µg/L in precipitation and 40 µg/L in enclosed lakes, although surface water concentrations are more typically less than 0.6 µg/L (Boutonnet, 1999). TFA has been reported to be present in ocean water at 0.2 µg/L at Noosa Heads, Queensland (Frank et al., 1996 and Frank & Klein, 1997 cited in Boutennet, 1999). Environmental concentrations are likely to include natural sources of TFA, such as volcanic emissions, as well as direct and indirect anthropogenic sources of TFA. The IPCC/TEAP (2005) report concludes that cumulative anthropogenic sources of TFA, such as from the degradation of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), are smaller than natural sources.; The lowest reported endpoint for the persistent degradant, TFA, is an algae no-observed effect concentration (NOEC) of 0.12 mg/L for Selenastrum capricornutum (Boutonnet et al., 1999).

The study indicates that the notified chemical is expected to degrade in the atmospheric compartment to eventually form water, oxides of carbon, hydrofluoric acid and trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). The extent of conversion of the notified chemical to TFA has not been established. Almost all TFA formed from precursors in the atmosphere is expected to be rained-out into the aquatic compartment (Young & Mabury, 2010). Like other perfluorinated acids, TFA is expected to be resistant to biotic and abiotic degradation and thus is considered very persistent in the aquatic environment.; The atmospheric degradation of the notified chemical is expected to result in rainout of the persistent degradant, TFA, into the aquatic compartment. Due to the long atmospheric lifetime of the notified chemical (about two weeks), TFA may be deposited in precipitation away from the site of release. TFA is ubiquitous in the aquatic environment and has been found at up to 0.2 µg/L in precipitation and 40 µg/L in enclosed lakes, although surface water concentrations are more typically less than 0.6 µg/L (Boutonnet, 1999). TFA has been reported to be present in ocean water at 0.2 µg/L at Noosa Heads, Queensland (Frank et al., 1996 and Frank & Klein, 1997 cited in Boutennet, 1999). Environmental concentrations are likely to include natural sources of TFA, such as volcanic emissions, as well as direct and indirect anthropogenic sources of TFA. The IPCC/TEAP (2005) report concludes that cumulative anthropogenic sources of TFA, such as from the degradation of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), are smaller than natural sources.; The lowest reported endpoint for the persistent degradant, TFA, is an algae no-observed effect concentration (NOEC) of 0.12 mg/L for Selenastrum capricornutum (Boutonnet et al., 1999). No other chronic endpoints were available. The median effect concentrations (EC50) for 10 other tested algae species were greater than 100 mg/L, while no effects were observed for fish and daphnia at concentrations of up to 1000 mg/L (ibid.).; In the atmosphere, the notified chemical may undergo long range transport but is not expected to be a significant contributor to global warming or ozone depletion. The notified chemical is a potential precursor of TFA, a persistent degradant that will rainout into the aquatic compartment. TFA is ubiquitous in the environment and is generally of low hazard to the environment. The introduction and use of the notified chemical is not expected to significantly increase background concentrations of TFA in the aquatic compartment from natural and anthropogenic sources.","IPCC/TEAP (2005) Metz B, Kuijpers L, Solomon S, Andersen SO, Davidson O, Pons J, de Jager D, Kestin T, Manning M & Meyer L (ed.)

Notified polymer released to sewer in washing water from carpet cleaning processes is not expected to be efficiently removed in sludge sewage treatment plant (STP). The notified polymer contains anionic functionality and has a molecular weight of more than 5000 Da, which indicates the notified polymer has a potential be removed in STP processes through partitioning to sludge. However, the usual predictive models for partitioning during sewage treatment are inapplicable for polyfluoroalkylated compounds such as the notified polymer. The typical models assume lipophilicity for hydrophobic functionality whereas the fluorinated functionality is both hydrophobic and lipophobic. The assumption that surface activity and/or high molecular weight results in efficient removal by sorption to sludge during conventional wastewater treatment has not been verified by supporting data for this class of polymer either. Therefore, a significant proportion of the notified polymer may remain in the aqueous phase following wastewater treatment noting its potential of being both hydrophobic and lipophobic.",,,,

The notified polymer is not expected to leach from the polymer matrix and is therefore not expected to be mobile in landfill. However, in landfill the notified polymer is expected to eventually degrade to form water, fluorinated compounds and oxides of carbon. These degradation products are also expected during thermal decomposition processes, as well as hydrogen fluoride. The notified polymer contains functionality that, over extended periods of time, may eventually degrade to form potentially persistent perfluorinated degradation products of varying chain length. Degradation of the notified polymer to form perfluorinated degradation products of varying chain length may occur over the short-term; however this is only likely under extreme temperatures and conditions.; Predictions of the environmental partitioning behaviour of polyfluorinated compounds remains uncertain based on current knowledge, because of limited data and their unique properties. In particular, the usual predictive models for partitioning during sewage treatment are inapplicable for chemicals containing perfluorinated functionality as they assume lipophilicity for hydrophobic functionality, whereas the perfluorinated functionality is both hydrophobic and lipophobic. Therefore, perfluorinated degradation products have the potential to enter surface waters, even following wastewater treatment. These degradation products are expected to be very persistent in the environment.; Any notified polymer that may be released during use is expected to remain in the soil compartment with a potential for some of the article containing the notified polymer to be washed to surface waters. In the soil and water compartments, the notified polymer is expected to remain incorporated in the inert polymer matrix. Over significant periods of time the notified polymer in the soil and water compartments is expected to eventually degrade to form water, oxides of carbon and potentially persistent perfluorinated compounds of varying chain length.; The risk quotient (Q = PEC/PNEC) for the notified polymer has not been calculated as release to the aquatic environment, in ecotoxicologically significant quantities, is not expected based on its reported use pattern. The majority of the notified polymer will eventually be disposed to landfill. The notified polymer is expected to remain in an inert matrix and is unlikely to leach or be bioavailable. The notified polymer contains functionality that may slowly degrade over extended periods of time to form potentially persistent perfluorinated degradation products of varying chain length. However, based on the incorporation of the notified polymer into a cross-linked inert polymer matrix and the expected limited environmental exposure and mobility of the articles formed using the notified polymer, the potential release of perfluorinated degradation products of varying chain length is expected to be limited. Degradation of the notified polymer in the short term may only occur under extreme conditions. Therefore, on the basis of the assessed use pattern and assumed low hazard, the notified polymer is not considered to pose an unreasonable short-term risk to the environment.

NA49,,,,,,"FM-450 has a very high molecular weight (number-average molecular weight of 2.53 x 105 + 2.0 x 104) and as a result is not likely to cross biological membranes.  Therefore it is expected to pose a very low health hazard.  The notifier estimates that low molecular weight polymers (<1000) will amount to no more than 0.1% w/w, a concentration which is considered to be too low to present any hazardous concerns to humans (4).  The notified chemical contains very low amounts of impurities (0.01 - 0.2% w/w) of which tumorigenic, mutagenic, teratogenic, skin sensitising or eye and skin irritant effects have been reported in animal studies (1).  Each of these impurities are present at levels below their concentration cut-offs values for classification as a hazardous substance (4, 5) and are therefore not expected to present any hazardous concerns to humans.  Similarly, as each residual monomer is present at <1% w/w, they are not expected to be hazardous to humans (4).  A mutagenicity study (2) suggests that FM-450 is not genotoxic.  However, due to the lack of toxicological data on this chemical and as it has only been used for approximately 18 months in Japan, prevention of direct contact with the notified chemical is recommended.

At room temperature, vapours have little or no effect on the skin or on eyes. However, in the liquid form, the notified chemical can freeze skin or eyes on contact, causing frostbite. Therefore, the use of protective clothing and eye protection is recommended when using the notified chemical.; • Employers should ensure that the following personal protective equipment is used by workers to minimise occupational exposure to the notified chemical as introduced:  − Safety glasses, gloves, and coveralls are recommended to avoid frost burns.","The notified chemical will be used as a heat transfer liquid (refrigerant) for air-conditioning units in industrial settings, and as a fire extinguishing agent.; As a fire extinguishant, the notified chemical will mainly provide fire protection for high value assets or irreplaceable objects that could be damaged or destroyed by conventional fire suppression agents. It may also be used with electronic equipment and circuits and is a point and shoot streaming agent to put out electrical fires in areas such as computer rooms, telephone exchanges and electrical switch gear.; Use as a Fire Extinguishing Medium The notified chemical can be used as a total flooding agent (the fire extinguishing concentration is distributed throughout the enclosure) or local application such as a handheld portable fire extinguisher where the extinguishing concentration is established in a localized area. The notified chemical is maintained in the storage container until release for the purpose of extinguishing a fire.; NUMBER AND CATEGORY OF WORKERS (FOR USE AS A FIRE EXTINGUISHING MEDIUM)  It is expected that the number of workers involved in the transportation, storage and repackaging of the notified chemical would be same as is for use as a refrigerant. However exposure would be significantly increased if release of the notified chemical occurs in firefighting. In addition, fire officers will also be using the fire extinguishing medium.; Occupational exposure is possible during import, transport, repackaging (decanting), filling, topping-up and emptying air-conditioning units, particularly when connecting and disconnecting transfer hoses, and during the release to extinguish a fire.; For use as a fire extinguishing medium, the main occupational exposure is expected during filling, maintenance of the system, an accident discharge, and during the release into a workspace to extinguish a fire.  Exposure during manual firefighting may occur. When fixed flooding systems are discharged, this may be done automatically and exposure may not occur.; Exposure to the combustion products of the notified chemical may occur during fire-fighting, and after re-entry to an area in which the notified chemical has been used as a fire extinguishant.; For use as a refrigerant, the general public will not be exposed to the notified chemical, as it will only be used in air-conditioning units in industrial settings. Similarly, for use as a fire-extinguishing medium, the general public will not be exposed to the notified chemical, as it will only be used by trained personnel. However, the general public can be exposed as a bystander during release into a workspace to extinguish a fire.; For use as a fire-extinguishing medium, the main occupational exposure risk is expected during filling, maintenance of the system, and during the release into a workspace to extinguish a fire or an accidental discharge. The notified chemical has a high vapour pressure and as a result, it will volatilise rapidly on release. Therefore, the most likely route of exposure to any released gas will be through inhalation. Furthermore, vapours of the notified chemicals are heavier than air and can cause suffocation by reducing oxygen available for breathing.  However, because the notified chemical will rapidly dissipate, exposure to elevated levels of the gas for any extended period of time will be unlikely, except in very confined spaces. Inhaling high concentrations of the notified chemical may cause temporary nervous system depression with anaesthetic effects such as dizziness, headache, confusion, loss of coordination, and even loss of consciousness. Inhalation exposure to high levels of the notified chemical may lead to cardiac sensitisation or adverse long-term effects.; There is risk of exposure to hazardous decomposition products of the notified chemical during and after the use of the notified chemical in firefighting. Precaution should be taken to avoid inhalation of hazardous decomposition products during and after the use of the notified chemical in firefighting.; For use as a fire-extinguishing medium, the main occupational exposure risk is expected during filling, maintenance of the system, and during the release into a workspace to extinguish a fire or an accidental discharge. Because this is a life safety devise, the notifier has advised NICNAS that there are significant required procedures in standards and regulations to assure human exposure to the agent is minimized and that the concentration must be below the 5-minute safe human exposure limit. These standards and regulations also require the owner to maintain the equipment and monitor for any leakage and immediate corrective action is also required if any leakage is detected. These standards and regulations also contain the required maintenance and inspection procedures to assure the unit is operational. The notifier has also advised that there are separate standards and regulations concerning the use of portable fire extinguisher.; The application as a refrigerant for use in air-conditioning units is directly related to a low volume industrial setting that does not have the public in close proximity. The application as a fire extinguishing medium will be used in industrial or commercial environment and public will not have direct access to the notified chemical or involved in its application. However, public may be exposed as a bystander for a brief period of time in the event of a fire.; RELEASE OF CHEMICAL FROM USE The deliberate venting to the atmosphere of hydrofluorocarbons such as the notified chemical is prohibited under federal and state legislation.  Technicians must be trained and accredited, and owners are required to maintain equipment and monitor for leakage, with immediate corrective action where leaks are detected.  Use for fire protection is considered non-emissive, as the gas is required to be contained within equipment unless needed for fire suppression, but release of the notified chemical from testing of fire protection systems is prohibited.; Estimated annual releases from transfer operations at user sites are 4% of the imported quantity.  Releases for fire suppression are impossible to predict, but expected to be low.  Use for fire suppression is expected to be restricted to high value applications.  A hypothetical worst case of 100% will be assumed for this assessment.; − Ensure that worker exposure to the notified chemical and its decomposition products during and after fire-fighting is minimised.; − The notified chemical must not be vented to the atmosphere, except when used for fire suppression.; − the function or use of the chemical has changed from use as a refrigerant or fire extinguishing medium, or is likely to change significantly;"

Perfluorinated compounds are known to be persistent and some of them are bioaccumulating.; 9.3. Comparison with Persistent Organic Pollutant (POP) Criteria; The Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) is a global treaty to protect human health and the environment. The convention contains criteria which address persistence,; bioaccumulation potential, long-range transport and toxicity concerns. These criteria are used to identify substances that may be candidates for inclusion in the treaty. The Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) entered into force on 17 May 2004. Australia ratified the Convention on 20 May 2004, and obligations of the POPs Convention entered into force for Australia on 18 August 2004. The Stockholm Convention requires parties under the Convention to take into account POPS characteristics when conducting assessments on new and existing chemicals.; Persistence No data has been provided on the biodegradation of the notified polymer. The notifier indicates that the notified polymer will not biodegrade in the environment for which there is some literature or other evidence. Thus the notified polymer would meet the criterion for POP chemicals. Based on data for PFOA and the information provided, the potential breakdown products perfluorohexanoic acid/perfluoroheptanoic acid/6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonate would be persistent in the environment (US EPA, 2003).; On the basis of the PEC/PNEC ratio the notified polymer may pose an unacceptable risk to the environment. However, it is acknowledged this would be a rare event and in most cases the relevant authorities would erect bunding to prevent releases in this situation.

Residual levels of the perfluorinated monomer in the notified polymer are stated to be < 0.1%.; No degradation products or pathways of the notified polymer have been identified, perfluorocarboxylic acids and fluorotelomer sulfonates are potential breakdown products (see section 8.1. for more details).; Perfluorocarboxylic acids The notified polymer has the potential to degrade to perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) and perfluoroheptanoic  acid (PFHPA) and trace amounts of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA)  and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) (NICNAS, 2006). In the absence of toxicological information for these breakdown products hazard information for PFOA will be used (NICNAS, 2006). The primary health effects of concern for PFOA are liver toxicity and developmental toxicity. A summary of the conclusions from the US EPA preliminary risk assessment of the developmental toxicity associated with exposure to PFOA and its salts (US EPA , 2003) are provided below.  Other systemic effects such as hepatooxic effects and carcinogenicity associated with PFOA are not covered by this risk assessment. A detailed review by NICNAS of the source data for this summary has not been conducted, the summary has been provided to give a brief overview of the toxicity profile of the potential breakdown products.; Perfluorotelomer sulfonates The following summary of toxicity data for a product ‘Zonyl FS-62’ containing the potential breakdown product 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonate was provided by the notifier (Dupont, 2004). A detailed review by NICNAS of the source data for this summary has not been conducted, the summary has been provided to give a brief overview of the toxicity profile of the potential breakdown products.; Perfluorohexylethylsulfonic Acid (27619-97-2) 12-18 % Ammonium Perfluorohexylethylsulfonate (59587-39-2) 6-9 % Perfluorooctylethylsulphonic Acid (39108-34-4) 1-3 WT% Ammoniumperfluorooctylethylsulphonate (149724-40-3) 1-3 WT% Acetic Acid (64-19-7) 1-3 % Water (7732-18-5) 60-85 %; The molecule has a perfluoroalkyl side chain (99% CF3(CF2)5-CH2CH2-) attached through a thio functional group which is linked by the alkyl amide functional group. In the environment the notified polymer could undergo cleavage at the R-S-R1 bond (or the oxidized sulphoxide or sulphone) and at the amide bond under both biotic and abiotic conditions. Depending on where the cleavage takes place a mixture of different products or a dominant product could be formed. In the case of cleavage at the R-S-R1 bond these include perfluoroalkylCH2CH2SH (or the oxidized forms), perfluoroalkylCH2CH2X (where X may be OH – ie a fluorotelomer alcohol or perhaps another nucleophile), perfluoroalkylCH=CH2 or perfluoroalkylCH2CH3 (if formed under reducing conditions). With cleavage at the amide bond, perfluoroalkylCH2CH2-S-CH2CO2H and its subsequent degradation products could be formed. Each molecule will have different reactivity, but their environmental fate will be determined by the perfluorinated side chain.; While there are some differences in structure, this pathway is possible. Whether the fluorotelomer sulfonate breaks down further is unclear, noting that perfluoroalkyl carboxylates were also detected at these sites though apparently there was no correlation between their concentrations (Schultz et al; 2004). Interestingly the parent compound could not be detected, possibly due to the need to develop additional analytical methodology.; Whatever the initial products of degradation, noting that a significant proportion of the notified polymer consists of the perfluoroalkyl group monomer, perfluoroalkyl containing functional groups such as sulphoxide, alcohol, carboxylates or similar products could be slowly formed. Recent literature indicates that fluorotelomer alcohols (FTOHs, a possible degradation product) are both sufficiently volatile (Stock et al, 2004a) and stable enough (Ellis et al, 2003) to be transported for long distances downwind from their points of emission. Stock et al (2004b) have recently reported that FTOHs are widely distributed throughout the North American troposphere. Most recently Wallington et al (2006) have demonstrated conversion of perfluorotelomer alcohols to PFOA and other perfluorocarboxylic acids. Given the persistence and lack of degradation pathways for the perfluorocarboxylic acids, it is reasonable to assume that, over prolonged times, it is possible for the initial degradation products to eventually degrade to perfluorocarboxylic acids. The expected end product from the; 6:2 FTOH and related substances likely to be released from the notified polymer are PFHxA and PFHpA. The notified polymer contains 1% CF3(CF2)7-CH2CH2- perfluoroalkyl side chain which may result in the release of trace amounts of PFOA and PFNA. Based on polymer composition information provided and assuming that the entire quantity imported per annum is released in that year, the estimated amount of perfluorocarboxylic acid that could be released per annum is 175 kg.; Perfluorinated compounds are the subject of reviews by the US EPA and the OECD and NICNAS has issued alerts for perfluorooctanyl sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) in Australia. Perfluorinated compounds are known to be persistent and some of them are bioaccumulating.; While perfluoroalkylcarboxylic acids have been detected in arctic seals, whales and birds, these have largely been the 9-15 carbon chain length acids. PFHxA and PFHpA have either not to date been found in biota or have not been found to be a major contaminant. PFOA has also not been found to be a major contaminant. The lack of detection of the lower homologues is attributed by Verreault et al (2005) to ""a comparable high depuration and excretion rate, and perhaps also low bioavailablity, bioaccumulation potential and exposure, as a result of low environmental concentrations”. Similarly the possible degradation product C6F13CH2CH2SO3- may not bioaccumulate.; Once released to the environment the notified polymer will be subject to biotic and abiotic mechanisms which will overtime, breakdown the polymer. No degradation products or pathways of the notified polymer have been identified. Perfluorocarboxylic acids and fluorotelomer sulfonates are potential breakdown products (see section 8.1. for more details). The pathways of human exposure to the perfluorocarboxylic acid PFOA are unknown (US EPA, 2003) however as PFOA has been detected in the serum on non-occupational populations it cannot be ruled out that the public could be exposed to low levels of the notified polymer’s breakdown products via environmental routes.; Health effects of potential breakdown products Once released to the environment the notified polymer will be subject to biotic and abiotic mechanisms which will overtime, breakdown the polymer. No degradation products or pathways of the notified polymer have been identified. Perfluorocarboxylic acids and fluorotelomer sulfonates are potential breakdown products (see section 8.1. for more details).; Based on the behaviour of PFOA, the potential breakdown products perfluorohexanoic acid/perfluoroheptanoic acid will bind to protein, distribute primarily to the liver, plasma and kidney and have a long half life in humans (US EPA, 2003). Based on its structure the potential breakdown product fluorotelomer sulfonate may also bind to proteins.; In the absence of data on the potential breakdown products perfluorohexanoic acid/perfluoroheptanoic acid, it is considered that these breakdown products could have a number of systemic toxic effects including developmental effects. Based on the limited data available the potential breakdown product 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonate is not classified as a hazardous substance in accordance with the NOHSC Approved Criteria for Classifying Hazardous Substances (NOHSC 2004). However, it is noted that the full toxicological profile of this breakdown product has not been investigated e.g. carcinogenicity.; Persistence No data has been provided on the biodegradation of the notified polymer. The notifier indicates that the notified polymer will not biodegrade in the environment for which there is some literature or other evidence. Thus the notified polymer would meet the criterion for POP chemicals. Based on data for PFOA and the information provided, the potential breakdown products perfluorohexanoic acid/perfluoroheptanoic acid/6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonate would be persistent in the environment (US EPA, 2003).; − further information becomes available about the breakdown of the polymer to perfluoroalkyl moieties and/or their toxicity.; US EPA Preliminary Risk Assessment of the Developmental Toxicity Associated with Exposure to Perfluorooctanoic Acid and its Salts.

Although, the pathways of human exposure are unknown limiting the release of the notified polymer into the environment would limit the risk of long-tem potential health effects. Therefore, it is recommended that the notified polymer only be used in essential situations such as fighting real fires, where no suitable and less hazardous alternatives are available.","Under fire-fighting conditions the notified polymer may be exposed to extreme temperature conditions. Thermal decomposition products expected are oxides of carbon, nitrogen and sulphur, together with the release of low molecular weight fluorocarbon compounds, and possibly hydrogen fluoride.; The notified polymer is not manufactured in Australia. It will be imported into Australia by sea as a 44% aqueous solution of the notified polymer. The notified polymer may also be imported (concentration ~0.3%) in fire extinguishers.; The notified polymer will be used as an additive for improving foam stability in aqueous fire fighting foam concentrates for hydrocarbon fuels. Typical end-users are fire brigades, industrial fire services and foam fire extinguisher manufacturers. Fire extinguishers will not be used in home or office environments.; The reformulation site is Kidde Australia Pty Ltd in Dingley, VIC. The aqueous fire fighting foam concentrates will be distributed to customer sites, e.g. fire brigades, industrial fire services, foam fire extinguisher manufacturers.; DYNAX® DX 5011 is transported into Australia by ship in 200 kg plastic drums. The finished fire; fighting foam concentrates are packaged into 20 L or 200 L drums and 1000 L intermediate bulk containers (IBCs). If imported in a fire extinguisher the notified polymer is packaged in an 800 mL cartridge within the extinguisher.; During the formulation of the fire fighting foam concentrates, the aqueous solution containing the notified polymer will be first warmed and then pumped into a bulk mixing tank (typical volume is 8000 L). Other ingredients are added (water, surfactants, corrosion inhibitors) and mixed for approximately one hour. The notified polymer makes up approximately 0.3% of the final fire fighting foam concentrate.; The final packaged product is sold to fire brigades, industrial fire services organisations and foam fire extinguisher manufacturers.   Fire brigade personnel and industrial fire service personnel would store the containers of finished product until required for use. It is expected they will drain off the required amount of concentrate into smaller containers for taking on to service vehicles. During fire fighting, it is expected the notified polymer will be further diluted (even to as low as 0.03%) in stream use. A hose and nozzle is connected to the drum or container containing the reformulated product and the water draws the product containing the notified polymer and forms a foam spray.; Fire extinguishers are checked every 5 years. Service technicians will load the cartridge with foam concentrate and replace back in the extinguisher.; Fire brigade fire fighters  >5,000 Up to 2 hours per; Industrial fire service personnel >500 Up to 2 hours per; Foam fire extinguishing manufacturer personnel; Formulation of foam fire fighting concentrate The batching and mixing areas are all equipped with local exhaust ventilation and opening doors to allow for natural local ventilation. However, dermal and limited ocular exposure to DYNAX® DX 5011 (containing 44% notified polymer) may occur when opening and closing the 200 Kg drums and when pumping the solution containing the notified polymer to the mixing vessel, and connecting and disconnecting transfer and filling lines. Inhalation exposure is not expected as the notified polymer is in solution form and the processes are not expected to generate aerosols.; Dermal exposure to the foam fire fighting concentrate containing 0.3% of the notified polymer may; End Use Fire brigade personnel and industrial fire service personnel have the potential to be exposed to the notified polymer (approximately 0.3%) when transferring the fire fighting concentrate to smaller containers. Fire extinguisher service technicians have the potential to be exposed to the notified polymer (approximately 0.3%) when filling the cartridge with the fire fighting concentrate. Dermal contact is likely to be the main route of exposure. Dermal and inhalation exposure could occur to the notified polymer (0.03-0.3%) during the application of the foam spray.  Contact may be prolonged depending on the end use circumstances. Fire personnel are expected to wear extensive PPE when using the foam.; The greatest potential for release of the chemical is through the use in fire fighting foams. Such fires would include those in flammable liquid stores, vehicle accidents involving flammable liquid tankers or water insoluble products of a flammable or combustible nature. The finished foam concentrate will typically contain approx. 0.3% of the notified polymer. The action of the foam based concentrate combined with water spray is to smother the fire – this level of notified polymer delivered could be as low as 0.03%. In cases where flammable liquid storage areas have foam fire fighting facilities containing the new polymer, it is expected these areas will have fire water containment such as bunding, sumps and onsite water treatment plants. The fire water would only be released to the sewer with prior consent from the local water authority. If consent is not granted, the waste is to be disposed of at a liquid waste facility.; The fate of the chemical in fighting “real” fires (such as a tanker accident) is problematic, as it will depend on the size of the fire and the amount of water and foam needed to control the fire. It is likely that it could enter local waterways via storm water drains, road surfaces and over land surface flow unless bunding of the accident scene occurred.; The formulated fire fighting foam is for industrial use only and as such negligible direct public exposure to the notified polymer is expected. The public could be exposed to low levels of the notified polymer and/or its breakdown products via environmental routes; Remarks    The notified polymer is considered to be stable up to 135°C.  Under fire-fighting conditions the notified polymer may be exposed to extreme temperature conditions. Thermal decomposition products expected are oxides of carbon, nitrogen and sulphur, together with the release of low molecular weight fluorocarbon compounds, and possibly hydrogen fluoride.; Literature evidence by Schultz et al (2004) has suggested that the ultimate breakdown products of C6F13CH2CH2SCH2CH2CONHC(CH3)2CH2SO3- are fluorotelomer sulfonates C6F13CH2CH2SO3-. The fluorotelomer sulfonates were detected at sites where the polymer had been used as a fluorosurfactant in AFFF fire fighting foam. the high levels found particularly at one site, would seem to rule out the presence of fluorotelomer sulfonates due to impurities in the parent polymer. The notifier therefore expects the notified polymer to similarly degrade to C6F13CH2CH2SO3-, which is one of the possibilities mentioned above.; The notified polymer will be primarily used as a stabilizer in fire fighting foam to fight fires that have flammable or combustible liquids as a fuel source. The main environmental exposure of the polymer will occur when it is used in fire-fighting training or use conditions. In the former case, conditions will be controlled, with bunding and traps preventing the release of both chemical and fuel, to the environment. Actual use may occur in areas where bunding or traps are used to prevent the release of the flammable or combustible liquids to the environment, such as storage areas or refineries or in uncontrolled situations such as tankers carrying flammable liquids.; The notifier indicated that for a fire in a flammable liquid store, the water/foam is contained and may be released to the sewer if approval is granted from the local water authority. The concentration of the polymer leaving the foam-forming nozzle is less than 3000 ppm (0.3%) and may be as low as 300 ppm (0.03 %). The release of the water/foam mixture to a metropolitan sewer will lead to a concentration in receiving waters of less than 30 ppm (assuming a 10X dilution on entering the sewer with a further 10X dilution on leaving the sewage treatment plant and no adsorption or degradation of the polymer). Lower dilution factors are likely in country areas and a maximum concentration of 300 ppm in receiving waters is possible, depending on sewage volume, flow of receiving water and concentration of the foam.; Should the chemical be used in fire-fighting on tankers or trucks carrying flammable liquids, there is potential for release of the chemical to the environment.; A realistic, worst case situation would, be an accident involving a fuel tanker, with run-off from the accident entering a lentic (still) body of water with significant wild-life. Information provided indicates that up to 12000 L of water/foam may be needed to control the fire if a fuel load catches alight. There is also the possibility 4000 L may be needed to cool the tanker and 4000 L to control any fire associated with the tanker.; In the situation where the fluid load catches alight, the total amount of the polymer applied would be about 48 L (0.3% x 16 [12 + 4] x 103 L). The density of 1.14 g/mL, gives 54.72 kg of the notified polymer potentially requiring dispersal. Some of this will be combusted/pyrolysed in the fire leaving the fluorinated residues, although the amount lost is expected to be small. Any notified polymer left would be associated with run-off from the accident site. Run-off into a pond of about 1 ha surface area and an average depth of 15 cm (volume of about 1.5 x 106 L) would give a maximum concentration of 36.4 mg/L.; One important assumption is that all of the polymer applied to the fire would be associated with run-off from the accident site. The run-off may not all flow into the lake, with some of the run-off adsorbed by road surfaces and soil surrounding the accident site. Where possible, standard operating procedures of Australian fire brigades should operate to minimise run-off by containment and removal. Also, some losses might be expected through adsorption to sediment and particulate matter because of the surface activity. On entering the surface waters, some of the chemical may partition to sediment due to its expected surface activity.; 2.) The run-off from the fire-fighting escaping to a lentic surface water; and 3.) The concentration of the polymer remaining near those affecting aquatic organisms for a few days.; Under the proposed use pattern as a fire fighting agent, practically all the notified polymer could potentially in run-off into the water compartment. The notified polymer is said to be highly water soluble and is potentially amphoteric where its cationic form may be highly toxic to aquatic organisms. However, the ecotoxicity studies conducted on Rainbow trout and Daphnia magna indicates that the notified polymer is expected to be practically non toxic to these organisms.; The worst case PEC/PNEC calculation for a fuel tanker fire gives a risk quotient of 16.3 (36.4/2.236) which indicates a potential unacceptable risk to the environment. Based on the worst case for a country liquid store fire estimated maximum concentration of 300 ppm in country receiving waters above, the Q of 134 also indicates a potential unacceptable risk.; 100), and adsorption/desorption, and it is recommended this be provided if import levels exceed one tonne per annum. This is particularly relevant in country liquid store fire situations where sewage and receiving water flow may be limited.; Formulation of foam fire fighting concentrate Although dermal and possibly ocular exposure to the notified polymer (up to 44%) may occur during formulation activities exposure is limited due to the largely automated process, the presence of local exhaust ventilation and the use of PPE.; End Use Although exposure to the notified polymer could occur when transferring the fire fighting concentrate to smaller containers or when filling the cartridge with the fire fighting concentrate exposure is expected to be low due to expected volumes involved and the low concentration of the notified polymer (0.3%).; The formulated fire fighting foam is for industrial use only and as such negligible direct public exposure to the notified polymer is expected.; Formulation of foam fire fighting concentrate The risk to workers involved in formulation activities is considered to be low due to the limited exposure predicted and the expected low toxicity of the notified polymer itself.  The notified polymer is a slight skin and eye irritant and as such workers involved in the transfer of the notified polymer as introduced (concentration 44%) should wear gloves and eye protection to minimise the risk of an irritation effect.; End Use The risk to workers transferring the fire fighting concentrate to smaller containers or filling the cartridge with the fire fighting concentrate exposure is expected to be low due to the limited exposure predicted and the expected low toxicity of the notified polymer itself. The risk of irritation effects is considered to be low due to the low concentration of the notified polymer (0.3%).; Although indirect exposure of the general population to the polymers degradation products is expected to be low, long-term potential adverse health effects cannot be ruled out.

In a recent publication (Taniyasu et al, 2003) PFBS was tested for in water, fish, birds and humans obtained from a number of locations in Japan, but not detected.  This may be due to insensitive detection limits compared with those for perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), which was detected in about 33% of fish blood samples, where there were much lower detection limits.; Earlier Moody et al (2002) detected PFBS only in two samples (at concentrations close to the detection limit, which was more sensitive than above) of fish livers taken from two sites (of the six tested) in a creek running beside an airport. PFBS was not detectable either upstream or downstream of the site where an aqueous film forming foam (AFFF) had been spilt at this airport.

This is understandable, in view of the electronegativity of fluorine and the great strength of the carbon-fluorine bond. Perfluorocarbons are more thermally stable than their corresponding hydrocarbon analogues. In particular, perfluorocarboxylic acids and perfluoroalkane sulfonic acids are considered the most thermally stable fluorinated surfactants. In addition to thermal stability, perfluorinated hydrocarbons are stable against degradation by acids, bases, oxidants and reductants (Moody and Field, 2000). Fluorinated carboxylic acids can undergo hydrolytic defluorination, reductive defluorination, and decarboxylation. To date, however, significant defluorination has only been observed for hydrolytic attack of monofluorinated carboxylic acids, and compounds of more than one fluorine atom per carbon atom are generally recalcitrant.; The notifier has provided degradation studies on the US carpet urethane polymer but not on the urethane polymer being notified in Australia. The results show no degradation from hydrolysis or biodegradation under the conditions of studies. There are some significant differences in structure between the two polymers and the notifier indicates that the notified polymer will ultimately degrade with the ultimate degradation product as perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS), which has been shown not to bioaccumulate. Due to the importance of these results these tests are assessed in detail below.; Remarks    The related urethane polymer was suspended into two sets of buffers of pHs 4, 7 and 9 at a concentration of 19.8 ppm. The first set was cooled to 0ºC and the second set was allowed to react with the buffer solutions for 6 days at 50ºC. Both buffer sets were analysed by HPLC/MS for perfluorobutanesulfonate (PFBS), perfluorobutyric acid (PFBA), 2-(N-methylperfluorobutanesulfonamido) ethyl alcohol (N-MeFBSE Alcohol), 2-N-methylperfluorobutanesulfonamide (N-MeFBSA) and perfluorobutanesulfonamide (FBSA). The results indicate that the related urethane polymer is unlikely to hydrolyse in the environmental pH range of 4-9, despite the presence of the hydrolysable functionalities.; The breakdown product of the notified polymer, perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS), has been assessed as the potassium salt by NICNAS (NICNAS 2005).  PFBS is expected to be persistent.; Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) has now been found in environmental samples all over the world and was formerly present in Scotchguard. The notified polymer will replace the PFOS component and contains the perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS) moiety. Compared to the higher homologues (C6 and greater), there has been very limited detection of PFBS in the environment, partly due to previous insensitive detection limits, and also probably due to low levels of use to date.  The published data are summarised in the following table.; blood) seem rather insensitive compared with those for perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), which was either detected in about 33% of fish blood samples (maximum concentrations in blood and liver were 121 ng/mL and 19 ng/g wet wt) or had much lower detection limits (<7.6 ng/g in liver, wet wt or ng/mL in blood).  It is unclear whether this reflects a much lower use level in the past.; Moody et al. (2002) detected PFBS by LC/MS/MS only in two samples at concentrations of 0.0090 and 0.0077 µg/g (both close to the detection limit of 0.0038 µg/g = 3.8 ng/g, and therefore more sensitive than above) of fish livers taken from 2 sites (of the 6 tested) in a creek running beside an airport.  By contrast PFHxS was detected in all samples, ranging from 0.011 to 0.29 µg/g.  PFBS was not detectable either upstream or downstream of the site where an aqueous film forming foam (AFFF) had been spilt at this airport, in contrast to PFHxS where the levels were 0.046 and 0.29 µg/g respectively.  Perfluoropentanesulfonate (PFPeS) was also detected at 4 of the 6 sites, though again levels were relatively low (range 0.0046 to 0.013 µg/g).; Perfluoroalkanesulfonates and perfluorocarboxylates are known to be present in AFFFs, as typified by PFOS levels being much higher (range 2.00 to 72.9 µg/g) at the eight sampling sites at this airport.  Higher homologs and perfluorooctanoic acid were also detected.; Water samples were also analysed for perfluoroalkanesulfonates and perfluorocarboxylates by LC/MS/MS, but only levels of PFOS, PFOA and PFHxS were reported, with the latter at a maximum concentration of 134 µg/L.  The paper notes other homologs were observed in water samples, including PFBS, but were not quantified.; Schultz et al. (2004) also used a direct injection, liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC MS/MS) assay to quantify a suite of perfluoralkyl sulfonates (PFAS) and fluorotelomer sulfonate (FtS) surfactants in groundwater collected from two US military bases where fire-training activities using AFFF had been conducted.  Levels of PFBS in ground water at the Naval Air Station Fallon, Nevada were <LOQ–210 µg/L, while they were 10–144 µg/L at Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida.  These were in the same order or somewhat lower than the higher homologues.  Total PFAS ranged from 0-1680 µg/L at the former and 273-3500 µg/L at the latter, which also had a total FtS content of 1100-14600 µg/L compared with none detected at Fallon (probably not used at this site).  Total perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) were 0-7090 µg/L at Fallon and 0-298 µg/L at Tyndall.; As noted above, levels of PFBS in the global environment currently appear to be very low, reported as at or below the limits of detection, except through contamination by fire-training activities using Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF). Whether this situation will remain so if PFBS use increases, for example by its wide substitution in products that currently include perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) or related higher homologues, is unclear.; For example, high mean concentrations of the polyfluorinated sulfonamide chemical N-methyl perfluorooctane sulfonamidoethanol (NMeFOSE) of 359 pg/m3 were identified in the air of Griffin, Georgia which is located in the main carpet manufacturing and treatment area of the US.  The authors hypothesise that the polyfluorinated sulfonamide probably enters the environment from carpet treatment products, many of which consist of fluorinated molecules linked to polymeric materials.  It is possible that free chemical may be left in the carpet fibres.  An alternative hypothesis is that the chemically-bound chemical NMeFOSE is released from carpets due to chemical, physical, and/or biological degradation processes. Paper products were also suggested by Stock et al., (2004) as a possible source of polyfluorinated sulfonamides in air.; Support for the hypothesis of release from carpets comes from Shoeib et al., (2004) who measured NMeFOSE and the related polyfluorinated sulfonamide chemical N-ethyl perfluorooctane sulfonamidoethanol (NEtFOSE) in indoor and outdoor air.  Mean indoor air concentrations for these were 2590 and 770 pg/m3, respectively, and the ratios between indoor and outdoor air were 110 and 85, respectively.  Shoeib et al., (2005) have recently published additional information confirming these results.; Members of the public may be exposed to perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS) by means of secondary exposure via the environment as a result of degradation of the notified polymer.  However, the risk to public health as a result of PFBS exposure is assessed as low based on the low toxicity of the breakdown product and the low predicted concentration of the notified polymer in the environment (See Section 10.1.3).; Kubwabo C, Stewart B, Zhu J and Marro L (2005) Occurrence of perfluorosulfonates and other perfluorochemicals in dust from selected homes in the city of Ottawa, Canada.

The chemical will be imported in pressurised, ready to use containers or tanks and used as a replacement gas for Halon 1301 in total flooding fire extinguishing systems. The notified chemical extinguishes fires by physically cooling the fuel and by the production of free radicals during decomposition which interfere with the combustion process.; Total flooding fire extinguishing systems are used in contained areas to protect such equipment as computer rooms and telecommunications switching facilities, oil production facilities, records storage facilities, aircraft cargo bays, flammable liquid storage facilities and laboratories, and public areas such as libraries, museums, shopping malls and tourist facilities. HFC-227ea is proposed to be used in industrial applications only, with typical firefighting applications involving dry electrical hazards, such as switching equipment, computer hardware and electrical circuits. It is estimated that; As the notified chemical will be imported and distributed in pressurised containers or tanks (0.5 to 10 tonnes), exposure during transport should result only in the event of handling accidents. The types of workers likely to be exposed in these situations include dock workers, warehouse workers, transport drivers, police and rescue personnel as well as firefighters.; During servicing and recharging of fire systems, installation fitters and maintenance personnel may be exposed to the chemical in the event of leakages of compressed gas from the tanks. The notifier has indicated, however, that leakages should be minor, and workers will wear appropriate gloves and goggles during servicing of the equipment to avoid cold burns.; The greatest potential for exposure will be during firefighting procedures. The notified chemical will be used in total flooding systems installed in fixed enclosures. The extent of exposure during firefighting will be entirely dependent on the number of fire emergencies and the materials fuelling the fires.; In order for the gas to be effective as a fire extinguishant, it will be used and maintained at a concentration of at least 5.8% (3). Concentrations will generally be between 7 and 9% but may reach levels greater than 14%.; Release of the chemical to the environment will normally occur only in the event of fire. Since the chemical is to be used in industrial, and not domestic applications, public exposure is unlikely in most situations.; Use of HFC-227ea will entail inevitable atmospheric release in the case of fire. Minor amounts may escape during recharging of fire extinguishing systems, but economic considerations would be expected to minimise such losses.; Animal studies indicate that HFC-227ea may potentiate the effects of adrenalin at concentrations above 9%. In an emergency fire situation workers will have elevated blood adrenalin levels, while some workers may also be taking sympathomimetic agents such as bronchodilators or cold medications. As a result, these workers will be at risk of cardiac effects (such as cardiac arrhythmia) if exposed to concentrations above 9%. At higher concentrations, there is a risk the notified chemical may displace oxygen in the breathing mixture resulting in oxygen deprivation and possibly death. Workers exposed to the gas during a fire, will also be at risk of exposure to corrosive and/or toxic thermal decomposition products, such as hydrogen fluoride.; Under normal use conditions, however, all personnel will be evacuated before the firefighting systems are started, and workers will be required to wear adequate personal protective devices if exposure is anticipated. As a result the risk to workers should be minimal.; During servicing of the fire suppression systems, gas may escape from pressurised tanks. In these situations the expanding gas may cause 'cold burns' if it contacts the skin. With appropriate personal protective equipment, the risk will be minimal.; . Restrictions on discharge of halons, except in the case of fire, should be retained for HFC-227ea as it has significant global warming potential. This should be reflected in the Draft Standard for FM-200 (HFC-227ea) Total Flooding Fire Suppression Systems, which currently (revision of 1 December 1993) specifies that HFC-227ea shall be the test medium for any discharge testing that may occur.; 2.

PLC384,The notified polymer is a component in a retail carpet treatment.,,"Degradation Products  The notified polymer is expected to degrade in the environment to produce perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS).; The fluorocarbon moiety is unlikely to be susceptible to biodegradation (Remde and Debus, 1996). This is understandable, in view of the great strength of the carbon-fluorine bond.  Perfluorocarbons are more thermally stable than their corresponding hydrocarbon analogues.  In particular, perfluorocarboxylic acids and perfluoroalkane sulfonic acids are considered the most thermally stable fluorinated surfactants.  In addition to thermal stability, perfluorinated hydrocarbons are stable against degradation by acids, bases, oxidants and reductants (Moody and Field, 2000). Fluorinated carboxylic acids can undergo hydrolytic defluorination, reductive defluorination, and decarboxylation.  To date, however, significant defluorination has only been observed for hydrolytic attack of monofluorinated carboxylic acids, and compounds with more than one fluorine atom per carbon atom are generally recalcitrant (Blake et al, 1997).  The notified polymer has a nominal fluorine content of ~24%. Studies have shown that fluorinated compounds with fluoride content in the order of 50% will not biodegrade over a period of 60 days (Remde and Debus, 1996). Further, fluorocarbons have little affinity for either water or organic phases and ultimately will concentrate near the surface of water bodies, for example when released in sewage treatment plant effluent. Here they are likely to be degraded by abiotic cleavage, with assistance from UV radiation, into smaller fluorocarbon species, which will be volatile and partition into the atmosphere. Here further reaction with hydroxyl radicals and action by UV radiation is expected to lead to degradation to hydrogen fluoride (HF) and precipitation to the surface in rain.; The above refers to perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) which has now been found in environmental samples all over the world and was formerly present in Scotchguard. The notified polymer will replace the PFOS component and contains the perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS) moiety. The Department of Environment and Heritage is aware of one recent publication (Taniyasu et al. 2003), which tested for PFBS in water, fish, birds and humans in Japan, but it was not detected. However, it is unclear whether this reflects a much lower use level in the past.; There are significant uncertainties surrounding the behaviour of fluorocarbon compounds in general in the environment in areas of partitioning behaviour, degradation, chronic toxicity and bioaccumulation, and the potential environmental impact of the breakdown product perfluorobutane sulfonate.; − the notifier become aware of information pertaining to the environmental fate or toxicity of perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS) the notifier should make this information available to NICNAS.

STD1035,"The notified chemical will be used for movie film cleaning, vapour degreasing and as a heat transfer agent.","The notified chemical is a highly fluorinated low molecular weight alkane ether and may persist in this environment. The initial degradation of the notified chemical in the atmosphere will occur through hydrogen abstraction by hydroxy radicals (Christensen et al. 1998). These species subsequently react with oxygen to produce the corresponding peroxy radicals which inturn react with oxides of nitrogen to form the corresponding alkoxy radicals. The authors observed that one of these compounds then reacts with oxygen to give the ester while another compound is converted to the formate, with the ester being the major product and the formate the minor product. The authors postulated that give the unreactivity of the ester to attack by chlorine and hydroxyl radical, the main atmospheric removal mechanism will be via wet/dry deposition and possibly photolysis. It is expected that the notified chemical will eventually degrade to HF and CO2. The paper estimates the average atmospheric half-life for the two isomers of the notified chemical in the atmosphere to be 0.77 years, but clearly degradation products are more persistent.

PLC314,The notified polymer is intended for use as a resin in powder paint preparations.,,"All wastes generated are disposed of in landfill through licensed waste contractors. In landfill, the powder containing the polymer is expected to be immobile owing to its low water solubility and is unlikely to leach into the aquatic compartment. The powder may undergo slow abiotic and microbial degradation over time. Biotic and abiotic processes will ultimately breakdown the non-fluorinated part of the notified polymer, while the perfluorinated part is likely to persist owing to the strength of the carbon-fluorine bonds. In cases where wastes are incinerated, this would produce oxides of carbon and potentially hazardous combustion products such as HF, COF2, and perfluorocarbons, and hence incineration should be carried out only in an approved hazardous waste facility.; Heating of fluoro polymers, however, can produce toxic perfluoroalkene gases, including perfluoroisobutylethene (PFIB).  PFIB is a colourless gas and a potent irritant of the eyes, skin and mucous membranes.  Exposure to PFIB can produce headache, cough, substernal chest pain, dyspnea and fever, followed by pneumonitis and pulmonary oedema within 24 hours.  Exposure to decomposition products from heated fluoro polymers without adequate ventilation may result in polymer fume fever, an influenza-like syndrome with symptoms of chills, fever, profuse sweating, cough, dyspnea, flue-like symptoms and chest tightness.  The symptoms are self-limiting and last between 24 and 48 hours.  The decomposition products of fluoro polymers are temperature dependent, with toxic fluoroalkenes produced at temperatures between 315 and 375ºC (Meditext, 2002).; Meditext.

Some specific uses include: streaming (portable extinguishers); flooding (total and localised, pre-engineered and engineered); explosion suppression; and inerting. The notifier indicates that it will not be commercialised for residential fire protection.; The notified chemical will not be formulated in Australia. The notified substance will be imported as a fire suppression chemical to be used to fill fire extinguishers and flooding fire extinguishing systems. Fire extinguishers and bottles will be filled with the chemical at the manufacturer’s facility prior to distribution to customer sites. Containers are 5 – 7L for extinguishers and 25 – 50L for fixed systems.; At customer sites, the notified chemical will be used in contained areas to extinguish fires, which may break out in areas such as computer rooms, and telecommunications and electronics facilities.; Filling storage bottles/fire extinguishers 4 – 6; The liquid fire extinguishant is transferred in a closed system as a liquid from bulk containers to bottles to be used as fire extinguishers or to be connected to fire extinguishing systems. The liquid is then super pressurised. Drips and spills may occur when connecting and disconnecting lines.; Bottles containing the extinguishant will be connected to a fire extinguishing system. Exposure to leaks may occur infrequently.; The notified chemical will be transferred into portable fire extinguishers (5-7 L) and fixed flooding fire extinguishing systems (25-50 L) prior to distribution to customer sites. Release is expected to be minimal during the filling process as the Fire Protection Association Australia’s Code of Good Practice for the Reduction of Emissions of Vaporising Liquid Fire Extinguishing Agents is followed and it is carried out in closed equipment via a direct line from the import drums and under super-pressurised nitrogen gas.  Minor amounts may escape during filling and recharging of fire extinguishing systems, but these will be minimised by good industrial hygiene practices.; Release of the notified chemical to the environment could occur during usage of the fire extinguisher to put out fires, while a portion of the chemical may consumed by the fire. The amount of chemical released during use would depend on whether portable or flooding systems are used to extinguish the fire. In most cases, release is expected to be relatively localised and isolated in occurrence.  Aquatic exposure is possible where the notified chemical is used in military application on ships.; It is expected that during transport, storage, and the filling of fire extinguishing systems, exposure of the general public to the notified chemical will be low, except in the event of an accidental spill.; The notified chemical will not be sold for residential fire protection. Consequently public exposure will occur in the event of an accidental spill or following the discharge of the fire extinguishing fluid. As this vapourises on discharge, there may be inhalation, dermal and ocular exposure.; No environmental exposure estimates were provided for the notified chemical. The notifier indicated that direct release of the chemical into the aquatic environment will be very limited and is only likely to occur at end use in military applications where the fire extinguishers are used on ships. Should the notified chemical enter the aquatic environment, very little is expected to partition into the water compartment, and that which does will hydrolyse fairly rapidly to 50% of a hydrolysis product and 50 % of 1,1,1,2,3,3,3,-heptafluoropropane (HFC-227), both of which are expected to be highly water soluble and resistant to biodegradation. In addition, as a gas, HFC-227 would partition to the atmosphere where biodegradation would not occur.; use of the substance in specialised fire extinguishers. Owing to its high vapour pressure and Henry’s Law constant, any compound released onto surfaces, or into water and soil is expected to quickly evaporate to the atmosphere.  In the atmosphere the notified chemical is expected to undergo photolytic degradation and to form fluorinated alkyl radicals. The atmospheric chemistry of fluorochemicals producing similar radicals demonstrates that these radicals and their degradation products have no impact on stratospheric ozone. The notifier has also indicated a low Global Warming Potential (GWP). Given these considerations and the low expected aquatic exposure, the notified chemical is not likely to pose a threat to the environment when used at the volumes and patterns indicated, particularly when the relevant users comply with the Fire Protection Association Australia’s Code of Good Practice for the Reduction of Emissions of Vaporising Liquid Fire Extinguishing Agents.; Exposure of workers can potentially occur while transferring the liquid notified chemical to fire extinguishers or bottles to be attached to fire protection systems. Typically engineering controls would be expected to be in place to minimise spills and leaks. The notifier has indicated that releases of extinguishant would be minimised by adherence to the Fire Protection of Australia NSW Committee Code of Good Practice for the Reduction of Emissions of Vaporising Liquid Fire Extinguishing Agents (FPAA, 2000). This code of practice references the relevant Australian Standards. Personal protective equipment required is indicated in the MSDS for the notified chemical. This includes: vented goggles, butyl rubber gloves and a supplied air respirator where necessary. Similar considerations apply to attaching bottles to fire suppressing systems and maintenance and refilling of those systems.; Fire extinguishers containing the notified chemical will not be sold to the public. Public exposure is likely to be acute exposure, arising from accidental spills of the notified chemical or from discharge of fire extinguishant due to a fire risk.; Exposure of workers during fire extinguisher and bottle filling, fitting bottles to fire suppressant systems, system maintenance, refilling and decommissioning is expected to be infrequent. The risk of adverse health effects is considered to be low given the low hazard of the notified chemical and the low exposure levels. Rare incidents have occurred where workers have been exposed to system discharges but adverse health effects under these conditions would be unlikely. There may be a low risk of burns to skin should there be exposure of skin during a leak of high pressure gas.; •     Recommendations contained in the Fire Protection Association of Australia NSW Committee Code of Good Practice for the Reduction of Emissions of Vaporising Liquid Fire Extinguishing Agents (FPAA, 2000) should be followed.; • For information on handling, storage, and disposal refer to the Fire Protection Association Australia NSW Committee, Code of Good Practice for the Reduction of Emissions of vaporising liquid fire extinguishing agents, July 2000."

EX32, of Tegosivin HE 503,"Although not required under the Act, the notifier has supplied a study of the biodegradability of the polymer (in French with some English translation).  The biodegradability of the notified polymer was investigated in accordance with OECD test guideline 301A (Modified AFNOR test). During the test, 100% disappearance of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was observed within five days of the commencement of the test.  This result was taken to indicate the substance is readily biodegradable under the conditions of the test, suggesting that the perfluorinated part of the molecule also degrades rapidly.  However, Remde and Debus (Remde A and Debus R, 1996) were not able to establish the fate of fluorinated moieties in the biodegradation of three different fluorinated surfactants investigated. They concluded that in all cases, the formation of a highly fluorinated water insoluble fragment with unknown toxicity could not be ruled out (even when one was readily degraded), and it is likely that the fluorocarbon portion will be persistent.",,"Additionally, the observed disappearance of the DOC may also be accounted for by the adsorption of the polymer to the sludge during the test (see above).  This would also be consistent with the fact that a polymer of this type with its relatively high molecular weight would be unlikely to degrade completely within 5 days (Cook B et al, 1997).  The vast majority of synthetic polymers are essentially nonbiodegradeable, and the assessment of the removal of polymers in wastewater treatment essentially reduces to an assessment of removal by sorption and/or precipitation (Boethling R and Nabholz J, 1997).  As noted above, the USEPA assumes that for cationic polymers 90% of the influent concentration of a cationic polymer will be removed by passage through a waste water treatment plant, and the remaining 10% is assumed to be discharged to receiving (Boethling R and Nabholz J, 1997).",,,

Emissions data were not available, however, a short-term exposure estimate of 216 ppm was provided, assuming a high use rate in a relatively small facility with no air changes. With normal ventilation (one air change per hour) and assuming the aerosol was used constantly throughout an 8 hour shift, the HFC-245fa vapour concentration would be 36 ppm. The EASE model predicted considerably higher vapour concentrations (500-1000 ppm), assuming direct handling with dilution ventilation.",,,,,"Based on the data provided, the notified chemical is not classified as a hazardous substance according to the NOHSC Approved Criteria for Classifying Hazardous Substances (NOHSC, 1999). However, as a NOHSC exposure standard is recommended (see below), HFC-245fa is a hazardous substance for the purposes of workplace regulations.; Based on the LOAEL of 2000 ppm established in the same study in this evaluation, and taking into account the lack of personal monitoring data available for the notified chemical, a provisional exposure standard of 200 ppm TWA is recommended until a NOHSC standard is established. The available monitoring data suggest this vapour concentration is achievable.; The NOHSC Chemicals Standards Sub-committee should consider establishing a national exposure standard for HFC-245fa, with this report serving as supporting documentation. Based on the incidence of myocarditis in a 13-week rat inhalation study, a provisional atmospheric concentration of 200 ppm TWA is recommended until a national standard is established.","Method 2: This method was implemented as a result of concern about the potential for losses of HFC-245fa in hot summer months during the blending and handling processes of Method 1. A calculated amount of HFC-245fa is pumped into a pressure container, into which a pre-blend of polyols, catalysts, cell stabilisers, fire retardant and non-volatile Zero OCP blowing agent has already been introduced. The container is rolled for a set time in order to ensure complete mixing of the pre-blend and HFC-245fa.

Decomposition products arising from pyrolysis are oxides of carbon, oxides of nitrogen, HCl, HF and perfluorocarbons.; No biodegradation data was provided, but it is probable that the hydrocarbon portions of the polymer will ultimately biodegrade and slowly mineralise to water and oxides of carbon and nitrogen. However, the fluorocarbon portion is unlikely to be susceptible to biodegradation (Remde and Debus, 1996) in view of the electronegativity of fluorine and the great strength of the carbon-fluorine bond. Perfluorocarbons are more thermally stable than their corresponding hydrocarbon analogues. In particular, perfluorocarboxylic acids and perfluoroalkane sulfonic acids are considered the most thermally stable fluorinated surfactants. In addition to thermal stability, perfluorinated hydrocarbons are stable against degradation by acids, bases, oxidants and reductants (Moody, 2000). Fluorinated carboxylic acids can undergo hydrolytic defluorination, reductive defluorination, and decarboxylation. To date, however, significant defluorination has only been observed for hydrolytic attack of monofluorinated carboxylic acids, and compounds of more than one fluorine atom per carbon atom are generally recalcitrant (Blake, 1997). The notified polymer has a nominal fluorine content of approximately 34% and studies have shown that fluorinated compounds with a fluoride content in the order of 50% will not biodegrade over a period of 60 days (Remde and Debus, 1996). Further, fluorocarbons have little affinity for either water or organic phases and ultimately will concentrate near the surface of water bodies, for example, when released in sewage treatment plant effluent. Here they are likely to degrade by abiotic cleavage, with assistance from UV radiation, into smaller fluorocarbon species, which will be volatile and partition into the atmosphere. Here further reaction with hydroxyl radicals and action by UV radiation is expected to lead to degradation to hydrogen fluoride and precipitation to the surface in rain. However, the fluorocarbon species may not take part in the destruction of the ozone layer, as is typical of chlorofluorocarbons.",,,,

They are likely to be degraded by abiotic cleavage, with assistance from UV radiation, into smaller fluorocarbon species, which will be volatile; Although the high molecular weight of the notified chemical would tend to preclude bioaccumulation (Connell, 1990), recent studies have shown evidence of significant accumulation of fluorinated hydrocarbons in the blood of higher trophic level organisms, including humans. The origin of the fluorocarbons is strongly suspected to be anthropogenic, and results from these studies have led a major fluorocarbon manufacturer (3M) to cease production of these compounds (Tullo, 2001). Research funded by 3M found fluorinated compounds in human blood and animal tissue in parts of the world where these are not manufactured (Moody and Field, 2000; Environmental Science and Technology/News, 2000). However, unlike perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS, an ingredient of a soon-to-be-discontinued oil and water repellent), which has been found at elevated levels in the tissues of organisms in remote marine regions well removed from major human activity, significant tissue concentrations of perfluorooctanoic acid seem to be far less widespread (Giesy and Kannan, 2001). Laboratory toxicity studies in rats and primates has shown that perfluorinated compounds can cause death in adult monkeys and rat offspring (Renner, 2001).

It is anticipated that prolonged residence in an active landfill environment would eventually degrade the notified substance.  The perfluorinated component of the polymer is likely to degrade to perfluorononanoic acid (C8F17CO2H), which will probably persist in the environment (Key et al., 1997).  Incineration of waste paper will destroy the compound with the generation of water vapour, hydrogen fluoride and oxides of carbon.; It is expected that waste polymer disposed to landfill will persist in the environment and may bioaccumulate. Fluorinated hydrocarbons have been shown to be resistant to biodegradation under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions (Remde and Debus, 1996), and abiotic cleavage of C-F bonds is not expected unless assisted by UV radiation.  Consequently, this portion of the new chemical is expected to persist in the environment. The notifier has suggested that the notified polymer will not be mobile.  However, the notified polymer contains a perfluorinated component, which will possibly degrade to perfluorononanoic acid. The closely related perfluorooctanoic acid has low affinity for both oil and water (3M, 1997), suggesting that perfluorinated compounds in soils are unlikely to associate strongly with the organic component and may be mobile.  However, it is noted the C6-C10 perfluoroaliphatic group is claimed to provide optimum surface activity.  In particular, the lower molecular weight fragments resulting from degradation of the perfluorinated acid are likely to be appreciably mobile in the soil compartment. The ultimate fate of these fragments would possibly be to the atmosphere where final mineralisation to carbon dioxide, water and hydrogen fluoride would take place through reactions with atmospheric ozone and further exposure to ultra violet radiation.",,,,

The notifier estimates that 200 – 500 workers in the building industry may be involved in application of the sealant containing the notified chemical and could be using the sealant 8 hours/day, 5 days/week.  The method of use is first to prepare the surface then extrude “beads” of sealant either by hand from the cartridge or by using a compressor operated gun to force beads from the cartridge.  Once extruded, the “beads” are spread by means of a spatula or a finger dipped in soapy water (to prevent sticking) although the latter is not recommended with the current product.  Dermal exposure to the sealant can, therefore, be frequent.  Some secondary exposure of the eyes and mouth may occur by transfer from fingers.  Uncured sealant is typically removed using solvents such as white spirit or acetone.  Cured material can only be removed with a blade.  Most of the work will be conducted on outdoor building sites where vapours are unlikely to accumulate.

The articles so produced will be used where fire safety and chemical resistance are required, such as in cable insulation, chemical process industry components, semiconductor processing equipment and tubing, rod and coatings for the oil and gas industries."
PLC154,d articles incorporating the cured polymer will also eventually be deposited in landfills at the end of their useful life.,"The majority of the polymer is not expected to be released to the environment until it has been moulded into components. Due to the high content of fluorine, biodegradation is unlikely, as this class of compounds are known to be very persistent in the environment.
