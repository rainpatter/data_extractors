The biodegradability of the notified polymer was investigated in accordance with OECD test guideline 301A (Modified AFNOR test). During the test, 100% disappearance of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was observed within five days of the commencement of the test.  This result was taken to indicate the substance is readily biodegradable under the conditions of the test, suggesting that the perfluorinated part of the molecule also degrades rapidly.  However, Remde and Debus (Remde A and Debus R, 1996) were not able to establish the fate of fluorinated moieties in the biodegradation of three different fluorinated surfactants investigated. They concluded that in all cases, the formation of a highly fluorinated water insoluble fragment with unknown toxicity could not be ruled out (even when one was readily degraded), and it is likely that the fluorocarbon portion will be persistent.",Fluorocarbon

EX42,"The notified chemical will be primarily used by local fire departments as a component in fire fighting solution. The chemical is added to water prior to being sprayed or hosed onto the fire, and its surfactant nature promotes the formation of a fire retarding solution as the water is discharged from the nozzles. The solution acts through fast heat reduction, fuel encapsulation and disruption of free radicals to extinguish the fire. This technique for fighting fires is particularly effective for hydrocarbon (e.g. fuel) fires, and fires involving other flammable liquids (e.g. alcohol). Consequently, it is expected that airport authorities will use much of the product and also chemical companies which may be involved with combating hydrocarbon and other flammable liquid fires. The rate at which the compound is added to the water depends on the nature of the fire and its situation. For example a fuel fire in a large storage tank would require different application strategy than a fire in a large wood heap or in a pile of old tyres. Nevertheless it is usual to add the F-500 to the water at a rate of approximately 1-3% corresponding to 0.45-1.4% of the notified chemical. F-500 is expected to be used primarily for class A (general combustibles) and class B (flammable liquid) fires, although some may be used in combating class D (metal fires) in ships or aircraft. When combating class A fires, the F-500 would be added to the water at a rate of 0.5-1%, while higher application rates are used when fighting class B fires.","The fire fighting agent F-500 is intended for industrial use only, and applied by trained workers of professional fire authorities. In the case of fire, the public will be evaculated from the sites. The notified chemical has a high vapour pressure (2.7 kPa). However, its high water solubility and expected dissociation in the aquatic environment will likely limit any tendency to partition to air, and concern for inhalation exposure is considered low. Hence, direct public exposure to the notified chemical may not be expected, except for accidental exposure in certain fire situations. Public exposure through drinking water may occur in the event of accidental release of the notified chemical into a river. According to the assessment by Environment Canada (unpublished), potential human exposure to the notified chemical through drinking water was estimated using an exposure scenario based on releases to a river following application during a fire event, and a dose of 0.157 ug/kg bw/event for an adult and 0.49 Âµg/kg bw/event for a child was calculated. Since the chemical is expected to be biodegradable and will unlikely become persistent, the exposure may be transient.",

LTD1056,As a 1% component of a fragrance oil which is a mixture of various aroma chemicals for use as a fragrance enhancer in cosmetic and household products.,"The notified chemical is moderately volatile (11.2 Pa at 25Â°C) and loss to the atmosphere is likely to be a relatively significant process from surfaces to which the fragrance oil is applied. In environments where volatilisation to the atmosphere is not able to occur (eg. deep waters, groundwater, subsoils), the notified chemical is expected to be relatively persistent. It is not readily biodegradable but will likely biodegrade over time as in biodegradability tests the notified chemical attained 38% degradation after 28 days and it would likely have degraded further with more time. The notified chemical will not readily hydrolyse in natural waters at environmentally relevant pH values, but in alkaline waters (eg pH 9 or greater) hydrolysis may be a significant degradation process (half life 13 days). It is moderately soluble in water (11.5 mg/L; Mensink et al., 1995) and has a density similar to water, but it has a potential to adsorb to particulate organic material and therefore accumulate in sediments due to this sorption and settlement. It is not expected to be very mobile in soils and groundwater due to its high sorption potential (log Koc 3.18) and moderate water solubility. With a log Kow of 4.48 and calculated bioconcentration factor (BCF) range of 562 (Meylan & Howard, 2000) to 1280 (Veith et al., 1979), the notified chemical has the potential to bioconcentrate in exposed aquatic organisms; however, no test data were available on depuration rates or actual bioaccumulated residues.",

It can be used in a variety of waterborne, solvent-borne and high-solids organic polymer coatings.","In the case of the fluorinated building block of the notified polymer, PFBS, the US EPAâ€™s PBT profiler predicts the chemical will be found predominantly in soil, but could also be found in water.  It is not expected to be found in sediment.  The overall persistence in the environment has been calculated by the PBT profiler as 290 days.  This allows the persistence of a chemical to be described using a single value and takes into account both the media specific half life and the rate of transport between compartments.  However, this parameter can not be measured and should be considered indicative only.  The chemical is not expected to bioaccumulate which supports test data (US EPA, 2003).","Wildlife International Ltd (2001a).  Perfluorobutane sulfonate, potassium Salt (PFBS): A Flow-Through

In environments where volatilisation to the atmosphere is not able to occur (eg. deep waters, groundwater, subsoils), the notified chemical is expected to be relatively persistent. It is not readily biodegradable but will likely biodegrade over time as the notified chemical attained 29% degradation after 28 days and it would likely have degraded further with more time. The notified chemical will not readily hydrolyse in natural waters at environmentally-relevant pH values. It is very slightly soluble in water (< 1.51 Ã— 10-5 mg/L; Mensink et al., 1995) so has a potential to adsorb to particulate organic material and therefore accumulate in sediments due to this sorption and settlement. It is not expected to be very mobile in soils and groundwaters due to its low sorption potential (Log Koc 2.77) and low water solubility.",

NA639,The notified polymer will be used to control corrosion and the precipitation of calcium carbonate and calcium sulphate in industrial water systems. All applications of the polymer will be for recirculating systems where process/cooling water is returned in a circuit either to the cooling tower or to a process water dam.,"Release of the notified polymer to the environment is most likely the consequence of blowdown from the cooling towers and non-evaporative water loss through leaks and drift. Given the low concentrations of polymer used in these applications and dilution  upon entering receiving waters, a high level of environmental hazard is not expected. However, large industrial cooling towers in rural areas may discharge directly to natural waterways â€“ i.e., rivers and creeks. Since the chemical is water soluble but is not readily biodegradable, it would be expected to be persistent in the water compartment.

NA649,The notified chemical will be used as a flame retardant in polyurethane foam production.,"Brominated flame retardants (eg. pentabrominated diphenyl ether or Penta-BDE) are widely used globally in the manufacture of flexible polyurethane foam products (content 5-30% by weight). However, health and environmental concerns due to the occurrence of this chemical in the environment and people have led to the banning/disuse of several compounds in some countries. As indicated by the notifier, a market for chemicals such as the notified chemical has developed. However, the notified chemical raises similar environmental concerns as other brominated flame retardants with similar use pattern as it may also be released to the environment through similar routes. The limited information available for the notified chemical indicates that it is very toxic to aquatic organisms, but is not persistent (based on an aquatic sediment test) and not bioaccumulative. If released into the environment or landfill, the notified chemical is likely to degrade over time, and is most likely to partition to sediments, soils and organic carbon (Log Koc >4.46). It is unlikely to be mobile in soils/sediments and is unlikely to percolate and affect groundwater. Due to its low vapour pressure (1.3X10-7 kPa at 25oC), volatilisation to the atmosphere is unlikely to be a significant migration pathway. With an estimated Henryâ€™s Law Constant of ~3.5X10-2 Pa.m3/mole, the notified chemical is essentially non-volatile from waters. PBT Profiler (USEPA, 2004) indicates that the notifier chemical is estimated to have a half life in air of 0.75 days. Within a wastewater treatment plant or sewerage system, the notified chemical is likely to partition to suspended particulates and sludge and degrade over time (USEPA, 2004). Site-specific treatment processes will determine the quantity collect as sludge or released with effluent. Due to its low persistence, the notified chemical is unlikely to enter a terrestrial environment (eg. soils) where sewage sludge or effluent is collected and reused as biosolids or irrigation water, respectively.",

Chlorinated dioxins and furans have attracted a great deal of attention due to their persistence in the environment, and the well documented toxicity of certain of their isomers. The conditions for formation of these compounds and the chemical mechanisms operating during the combustion processes has also attracted a great deal of research and debate.

Wider applications of Gulftene 14 include: metal working fluid, dielectric fluid, solvent applications, ingredient in detergents and as an intermediate in the production of paper sizing agents and lubricating additives.","Nevertheless, once discharged overboard, it is likely that the drill cuttings with residual drilling fluid will persist for some time in the vicinity of the well.  The notifier provided a copy of a paper (Oliver GA 1998), which summarised studies of the persistence of residual drilling fluids in the vicinity of three drilling rigs on the North West Shelf of WA.

Approximately 70 kg/year of notified polymer will be imported in 650g aluminium-laminated packets, which will be packed in cartons (15 packets per carton).",,"It is expected that waste polymer disposed to landfill will persist in the environment and may 
bioaccumulate. Fluorinated hydrocarbons have been shown to be resistant to biodegradation 
under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions (Remde and Debus, 1996), and abiotic cleavage 
of C-F bonds is not expected unless assisted by UV radiation.  Consequently, this portion of 
the new chemical is expected to persist in the environment. The notifier has suggested that 
the notified polymer will not be mobile.  However, the notified polymer contains a 
perfluorinated component, which will possibly degrade to perfluorononanoic acid. The 
closely related perfluorooctanoic acid has low affinity for both oil and water (3M, 1997), 
suggesting that perfluorinated compounds in soils are unlikely to associate strongly with the 
organic component and may be mobile.  However, it is noted the C6-C10 perfluoroaliphatic 
group is claimed to provide optimum surface activity.  In particular, the lower molecular 
weight fragments resulting from degradation of the perfluorinated acid are likely to be 
appreciably mobile in the soil compartment. The ultimate fate of these fragments would 
possibly be to the atmosphere where final mineralisation to carbon dioxide, water and 
hydrogen fluoride would take place through reactions with atmospheric ozone and further 
exposure to ultra violet radiation."

Research found fluorinated compounds in human blood and animal tissue in parts of the world where these are not manufactured (Environmental Science and Technology/News, 2000). Laboratory toxicity studies in rats and primates showed that such compounds can cause death in adult monkeys and rat offspring. In addition, the US EPA have stated â€œThis widespread presence, persistence and bioaccumulation potential and the reproductive and subchronic toxicity of the chemical raises concerns for potential adverse effects on people and wildlifeâ€ (Chemical Regulation Observer, 2000).","No biodegradation data was provided, but it is probable that the hydrocarbon portions of the 
polymer will ultimately biodegrade and slowly mineralise to water and oxides of carbon and 
nitrogen. However, the fluorocarbon portion is unlikely to be susceptible to biodegradation 
(Remde and Debus, 1996) in view of the electronegativity of fluorine and the great strength 
of the carbon-fluorine bond. Perfluorocarbons are more thermally stable than their 
corresponding hydrocarbon analogues. In particular, perfluorocarboxylic acids and 
perfluoroalkane sulfonic acids are considered the most thermally stable fluorinated 
surfactants. In addition to thermal stability, perfluorinated hydrocarbons are stable against 
degradation by acids, bases, oxidants and reductants (Moody, 2000). Fluorinated carboxylic 
acids can undergo hydrolytic defluorination, reductive defluorination, and decarboxylation. 
To date, however, significant defluorination has only been observed for hydrolytic attack of 
monofluorinated carboxylic acids, and compounds of more than one fluorine atom per carbon 
atom are generally recalcitrant (Blake, 1997). The notified polymer has a nominal fluorine 
content of approximately 34% and studies have shown that fluorinated compounds with a 
fluoride content in the order of 50% will not biodegrade over a period of 60 days (Remde and 
Debus, 1996). Further, fluorocarbons have little affinity for either water or organic phases 
and ultimately will concentrate near the surface of water bodies, for example, when released 
in sewage treatment plant effluent. Here they are likely to degrade by abiotic cleavage, with 
assistance from UV radiation, into smaller fluorocarbon species, which will be volatile and 
partition into the atmosphere. Here further reaction with hydroxyl radicals and action by UV 
radiation is expected to lead to degradation to hydrogen fluoride and precipitation to the 
surface in rain. However, the fluorocarbon species may not take part in the destruction of the 
ozone layer, as is typical of chlorofluorocarbons."

The origin of the fluorocarbons is strongly suspected to be anthropogenic, and results from these studies have led major fluorocarbon manufacturer (3M) to cease production of these compounds (C & EN, 2001). Research funded by 3M found fluorinated compounds in human blood and animal tissue in parts of the world where these are not manufactured (Moody and Field, 2000; Environmental Science and Technology/News, 2000).

NA976,"The notified chemical will be primarily used by local fire departments as a component in fire fighting solution. The chemical is added to water prior to being sprayed or hosed onto the fire, and its surfactant nature promotes the formation of a fire retarding solution as the water is discharged from the nozzles. The solution acts through fast heat reduction, fuel encapsulation and disruption of free radicals to extinguish the fire. This technique for fighting fires is particularly effective for hydrocarbon (e.g. fuel) fires, and fires involving other flammable liquids (e.g. alcohol). Consequently, it is expected that airport authorities will use much of the product and also chemical companies which may be involved with combating hydrocarbon and other flammable liquid fires. The rate at which the compound is added to the water depends on the nature of the fire and its situation. For example a fuel fire in a large storage tank would require different application strategy than a fire in a large wood heap or in a pile of old tyres.

The origin of the fluorocarbons is strongly suspected to be anthropogenic, and results from these studies have led a major fluorocarbon manufacturer (3M) to cease production of these compounds (Tullo, 2001). Research funded by 3M found fluorinated compounds in human blood and animal tissue in parts of the world where these are not manufactured (Moody and Field, 2000; Environmental Science and Technology/News, 2000). However, unlike perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS, an ingredient of a soon-to-be-discontinued oil and water repellent), which has been found at elevated levels in the tissues of organisms in remote marine regions well removed from major human activity, significant tissue concentrations of perfluorooctanoic acid seem to be far less widespread (Giesy and Kannan, 2001). Laboratory toxicity studies in rats and primates has shown that perfluorinated compounds can cause death in adult monkeys and rat offspring (Renner, 2001). In addition, the US EPA have stated â€œThis widespread presence, persistence and bioaccumulation potential and the reproductive and subchronic toxicity of the chemical (PFOS) raises concerns for potential adverse effects on people and wildlifeâ€ (Chemical Regulation Reporter, 2000).","Geisy JP and Kannan K (2001) Global Distribution of Perfluoroocatne Sulfonate in

However, the chemical structure of the compound indicates that it does not contain groups known to be highly refractory to biodegradation, although biodegradation is likely to be a slow process.  It is expected that under aerobic conditions the compound will be ultimately mineralised to water, oxides of carbon (carbonates) and oxides of nitrogen, while in anaerobic environments the primary degradation products would be methane, oxides of carbon and ammonia.  The chemical has a cationic residue, and consequently is expected to interact strongly with negatively charged colloidal material in the environment.

Whilst these findings were not considered biologically relevant, as they were present at the end of the recovery period and not during the treatment phase and were generally within historical control data, the observation should be dismissed with caution. Apropos, the appearance of toxic effects in the recovery phase may be an indication of late-onset biochemical processes the persistence of which may reasonably lead to a toxic phenotype.

STD1410,The notified chemical will be used as a component (at < 20%) of a textile dye for dyeing carpet and carpet tiles. In future it may find application in dyeing wool and nylon yarns and fabrics.,"A hydrolysis study on the notified chemical indicated that it is hydrolytically stable in water. Studies submitted on the notified chemical indicate it is not readily biodegradable nor inherently biodegradable. Therefore the notified chemical has the potential to be persistent in the environment. Notified chemical released to sewer is not likely to be removed from the water column during sewage treatment plant (STP) processes as it has a low soil absorption coefficient (Koc) and is not expected to degrade rapidly. The notified chemical released to STPs is therefore expected to reach surface waters. The notified chemical is not expected to bioaccumulate based on its high water solubility, high molecular weight and charge.",

The notified chemical acts by delaying nitrification of ammonia and urea nitrogen fertilisers through the inhibition of soil bacteria.,"Remarks â€“ Method Run-off is highly dependent on several factors, some of which are location specific and others event specific. The most important are rainfall and its intensity, infiltration of soil (in turn related to moisture content of soil), the slope, type of soil, type of drainage, crop type, amount of trash on soil and cultivation (Mensink et al., 1996). Other influences include mobility and persistence of the chemical, formulation type and formulation placement (Grover, 1989).",
STD1413,The notified chemical will be used as an optical brightener for use in paper making.,"The notified chemical is therefore not expected to be fully removed from the effluents of waste water treatment plants. Although the notified chemical  has a high water solubility, some of notified chemical discharged in treated effluent is expected to partition to sludge and sediment, based on the high measured adsorption/desorption coefficient (log Koc = 3.75). The rate of abiotic degradation may be slow based on the apparent hydrolytic stability of the chemical and it may persist in the water column. Although potentially persistent in the water compartment, the notified chemical is unlikely to bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms based on the low measured log Kow and the relatively large molecular dimensions of the chemical.",

STD1433,The notified chemical will be used as a component of toothpaste at ? 11% concentration.,"No environmental fate data were submitted. The majority of the notified chemical is expected to be released to sewer during use. Due to its likely high water solubility and low n-octanol/water partition coefficient, the notified chemical is expected to remain in the aqueous phase. It is also expected to dissociate and be in its ionised state in the environment. A portion of the cationic constituent of the notified chemical may sorb to sludge and be removed during sewage treatment plant (STP) processes. The bicarbonate constituent is expected to remain in the aqueous phase. In the aqueous waste stream, the notified chemical or its respective dissociated constituent ions are expected to eventually disperse and degrade. Less than 6% of the notified chemical is expected to be released to landfill due to disposal of spills and residues remaining in product containers. The dissociated constituent ions of the notified chemical are likely to leach from landfill and enter surface waters due to their high water solubility. The cationic constituent of the notified chemical may have reduced mobility in soil. Arginine is likely to be rapidly biodegradable based on modelled data (US EPA, 2012b) and biodegradation pathways for amino acids (Jones, 2005). Therefore, the notified chemical is not likely to be persistent in the environment. Upon entering surface waters, it is expected to degrade via biotic and abiotic processes to form water and oxides of carbon and nitrogen. The notified chemical is also not expected to bioaccumulate due to its low bioaccumulation factor (log BCF = -0.5; US EPA, 2011b), very low n-octanol partition coefficient (log POW) and high solubility in water.",
