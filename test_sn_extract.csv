The ink is packed in foil pouches which will be inserted into cartridges andused in wide -format commercial printers.6. HUMAN HEALTH RISK ASSESSMENTNo toxicological data were submitted. The notified polymer meets the PLC cr iteria and is thereforeassumed to be of low hazard. The risk of the notified polymer to occupational and public health is notconsidered to be unreasonable given the assumed low hazard and the assessed use pattern .7. ENVIRONMENTAL RISK ASSESSMENTNo ecot oxicological data were submitted. Anionic polymers are known to be moderately toxic to algae.The mode of toxic action is over -chelation of nutrient elements needed by algae for growth. Thehighest toxicity is when the acid is on alternating carbons of the polymer backbone. This is unlikelyapply to the notified polymer and it is therefore not considered to be an over -chelation hazard to algae.The notified polymer also contains potentially cationic functionality, however the cationic chargedensity is low and the notified polymer is therefore not expected to be of concern to the aquaticenvironment. April 2016 NICNASPUBLIC REPORT: EX/200 ( PLC/1050) Page 6 of 6The notified polymer will be imported as a component of printer ink in sealed inkjet cartridges.Printing cartridges are designed to prevent release of its con tents during transport, installation andremoval. Accidental spills are expected to be contained and disposed of to landfill. The ink will beused on paper articles, and notified polymer bound within the dried ink matrix will share the fate ofthe article. It is anticipated that approximately half of these articles will be disposed of to landfill andthe remainder will be recycled at the end of their useful lifetime. Approximately 50% of the paper onwhich the products will be printed will be recycled. Most of the notified polymer will reach landfill asa result of disposal of used paper and empty cartridges, or sludge waste from paper recyclingprocesses. In landfill the notified polymer is expected to be immobile due to its low solubility in waterand will likely undergo slow biotic and abiotic degradation processes to form water and oxides ofcarbon and nitrogen. The notified polymer is not expected to cross biological membranes due to itshigh molecular weight and is thus not likely to bioaccumulate. The notified polymer is therefore notexpected to pose an unreasonable risk to the environment based on the assessed use pattern.8. RISK ASSESSMENT FOR EXTENSION APPLICATIONThe notified polymer will be imported as a component in finished inkjet printing i nk formulation infoil pouches (at a concentration up to 10%), and will not be reformulated in Australia. The usescenario is covered under the original notification (PLC/1050). The proposed use, import volume andfate of the notified polymer will not chang e significantly under the proposed extension. Thecircumstances in the extension application are not expected to impact on the original human health and environment risk assessment."

INTRODUCTION AND USE INFORMATIONMaximum Introduction Volume of Notified Chemical (100%) Over Next 5 YearsYear 1 2 3 4 5Tonnes 1–10 1–10 1–10 1–10 1–10November 2017 NICNASPUBLIC REPORT: PLC/ 1448 Page 5 of 5 UseThe notified polymer will not be manufactured or reformulated in Australia. It will be imported in partA of a two-part adhesive system at up to 30% concentration. The adhesive will be applied to thesubstrate surface using a dispensing gun. The adhesive will be used by professionals only.6. HUMAN HEALTH RISK ASSESSMENTNo toxicological data were submitted. The not ified polymer meets the PLC criteria and can thereforebe considered to be of low hazard.Although not considered in this risk assessment, NICNAS notes that the notified polymer containsresidual monomers that are classified as hazardous according to the Globally Harmonised System ofClassification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS ), as adopted for industrial chemicals in Australia.The risk of the notified polymer to occupational and public health is not considered to be unreasonablegiven the assumed low hazard and the assessed use pattern.7. ENVIRONMENTAL RISK ASSESSMENTNo ecotoxicological data were submitted for the notified polymer. The notified polymer containspotential cationic functionalities, however the functional group equivalent weight (FGEW) of thenotified polymer is higher than 5,000 g/mol ; therefore , the notified polymer is not expected to be ofconcern to the aquatic environment.The notified polymer will be imported into Australia as a component in part A of two- part adhesiveproducts. A ccidental spills of the notified polymer during import, transport or storage are expected tobe adsorbed onto a suitable material and collected for disposal in accordance with local regulations.The adhesive products will be applied onto the substrate using a dispensing gun by professionalcontractors only. The dispenser will be cleaned using a suitable solvent and the waste solvent is then collected by a licensed waste contractor for disposal. Small amounts of the notified polymer mayremain as residues in empty packages, which are expected to be disposed of in accordance with localregulations along with the packages.Based on its use pattern, most of the notified polymer is expected to share the fate of the articles onwhich it applied to, to be dispos ed of to landfill at the end of their life cycle . Significant release of thenotified polymer to the aquatic environment is not expected. In landfill, the notified polymer will be present as cured solids and will be neither bioavailable nor mobile. The not ified polymer is notexpected to bioaccumulate due to its high molecular weight. The notified polymer is expected toeventually degrade via biotic and abiotic processes to form water and oxides of carbon and nitrogen.Therefore, based on its assumed low hazard and assessed use pattern, the notified polymer is notconsidered to pose an unreasonable risk to the environment ."

INTRODUCTION AND USE INFORMATIONMaximum Introduction Volume of Notified Chemical (100%) Over Next 5 YearsYear 1 2 3 4 5Tonnes 25 25 25 25 25UseThe notified polymer will not be manufactured in Australia. The notified polymer will be importedinto Australia at a concentration of approximately 32% . Products containing the notified polymer willbe reformulated in Australia in closed systems under exhaust ventilation. The notified polymer will beused as a component of overprint varnishes and barrier coatings for packaging; product s containing thenotified polymer will not be used by the public . The public will have dermal contact with articles thathave been coated with products containing the notified polymer . However , once the coating dries, thenotified polymer would be trappe d in the printed paper, and therefore dermal exposure to the notifiedpolymer from contact with the dried coating is not expected.6. HUMAN HEALTH RISK ASSESSMENTThe notified polymer has a high molecular weight (Mn > 10,000 Da) and expected low watersolubility and will be manufactured as an aqueous dispersion. As such, the notified polymer maypresent a concern for potential lung damage following respiration of particles. Delivery in the nanoform through biological membranes is not expected as the noti fied polymer will lose itsnanostructure upon contact and collapse into a film.No toxicological data were submitted. The notified polymer meets the PLC criteria and is thereforeassumed to be of low hazard. The risk of the notified polymer to occupational and public health is notconsidered to be unreasonable given the assumed low hazard and the assessed use pattern. September 2012 NICNASPUBLIC REPORT: PLC/1016 Page 5 of 57. ENVIRONMENTAL RISK ASSESSMENTNo ecotoxicological data were submitted. Anionic polymers are known to be moderately toxic to algae. The mode of toxic action is over -chelation of nutrient elements needed by algae for growth. Thehighest toxicity is when the acid is on alternating carbons of the polymer backbone. This does notapply to the notified polymer and it is therefore not considered to be an over -chelation hazard to algae.The notified polymer also contains pote ntially cationic functionality, however the cationic chargedensity is low and the notified polymer is therefore not expected to be of concern to the aquaticenvironment.The notified polymer will be reformulated locally into products for use in overprint varnishes andbarrier coating. It is estimated that up to 1% of the notified polymers may be spilt during reformulation.Any accident spills occurring during reformulation will be contained within bunding and disposed ofby a licensed waste contractor, wh ich is expected to be eventually disposed of to landfill . It isestimated that <1% of notified polymer will be present in washes after equipment cleaning, which willundergo a process of flocculation and be disposed of to landfill. Residues in empty import edcontainers are estimated to be less than 1%, and be directly sent to landfill with the containers.Following its use in commercial printing and coating, most of the notified polymer will be boundwithin the polymeric matrix adhering paper or plastic s ubstrates. Most of the notified polymer isexpected to share the fate of article and be disposed of to landfill or recycled. The majority of notifiedpolymer is expected to be removed in sludge during waste water treatment at paper recycling facilitiesand sewage treatment plants. Small quantities of the notified polymer may be released to surfacewaters. However, the notified polymer is expected to be of low hazard to aquatic organisms. Thenotified polymer in sludge is expected to be disposed of to landfi ll or applied to agricultural soils. Inlandfill and soils, the notified polymer expected to eventually degrade to form water and oxides ofcarbon, silicon and nitrogen. The notified polymer is expected to be hydrolytically stable and is notexpected to be readily biodegradable. However, d ue to its high molecular weight it is not expected tocross biological membranes and is therefore unlikely to bioaccumulate. Therefore, based on itsassumed low hazard and assessed use pattern, the notified polymer is not considered to pose anunreasonable risk to the environment."

It will be imported at < 60% concentrationfor reformulation. The notified polymer will be used as a component in concrete floor screeds atconcentrations up to 0.5%.6. HUMAN HEALTH RISK ASSESSMENTNo toxicological data were submitted. The notified polymer meets the PLC criteria and is thereforeassumed to be of low hazard. The risk of the notified polymer to occupational and public health is notconsidered to be unreasonable given the as sumed low hazard and the assessed use pattern .7. ENVIRONMENTAL RISK ASSESSMENTNo ecotoxicological data were submitted. Polymers without significant ionic functionality are generallyof low concern to the environment.Release of the notified polymer to the aquatic environment is not expected during reformulation as spillsand residues in import containers will be readily contained and collected for disposal to landfill. Manufacturing equipment will be rinsed with solvents and the washings will be stored in holding tankson-site for disposal by licensed waste contractors. When disposed of to landfill, the notified polymer isexpected to eventually degrade via abiotic and biotic processes to form water and oxides of carbon .The majority of the notified pol ymer will be not be released during use as it is irreversibly incorporatedwithin a solid matrix in concrete flooring. Therefore the majority of notified polymer will share the fate of the flooring of which it is a component and be disposed of to landfill at the end of its useful life, ordestroyed during material reclamation processes. In landfill, the notified polymer will be neitherbioavailable nor mobile.The notifier has indicated that a small percentage (5%) of the annual import volume will be avail able toDIY users. In this context, waste water from cleaning processes may be incorrectly disposed of to the sewer, drains or ground.The notified polymer is likely to have some (albeit low) solubility in waterbased on its molecular structure. Therefore, assuming a worst -case scenario where 5% of the volumeavailable to DIY users (5% of 5% = 0.25% of the total annual volume) is released to water systems and there is no removal at sewage treatment plants, the predicted environment concentration (PEC) iscalculated to be 0.11 µg/L in rivers and 0.01 µg/L in the ocean based on the release occurring nationwideover 365 days a year [PEC = 75 000 kg/year × 0.25% ÷ 365 days ÷ (200.0 L/person/day × 24.386 millionpeople)]. As the notified polymer is likely to be of low concern to the environment, the PEC of thenotified polymer indicates that is not expected to reach ecotoxicologically relevant concentrations in theaquatic environment. Upon release to surface waters, the notified polymer is expected to partition tosediment based on its high molecular weight and presence of hydrophobic groups. The notified polymeris not expected to cr oss biological membranes or bioaccumulate due to its high molecular weight. Thenotified polymer is expected to eventually degrade to form water and oxides of carbon vi a biotic andabiotic processes.Therefore, based on its assumed low hazard and reported use pattern, the notified polymer is notconsidered to pose an unreasonable risk to the environment."

HUMAN HEALTH RISK ASSESSMENTNo toxicological data were submitted. The notified polymer meets the PLC criteria and is thereforeassumed to be of low hazard. The risk of the notified polymer to occupational and public health is notconsidered to be unreasonable given the assumed low ha zard and the assessed use pattern .7. ENVIRONMENT RISK ASSESSMENTNo ecotoxicological data were submitted. Polymers without significant ionic functionality aregenerally of low concern to the environment.During use of the notified polymer as a component of automotive refinish paint products in industrialsettings, up to 2% of the annual import volume may be released as spills, container residues, containerand equipment washings and waste material. These releases are expected to be collected and sent to alicensed hazardous waste facility for disposal in accordance with state/territory waste standards. The main release (up to 40% as overspray during use) will typically entail landfill disposal, afterinterception by spray booth filters. Discarded end use articles containing the notified polymer withinthe cured paint film will be disposed to landfill, or recycled for metals reclamation which will entailthermal decomposition of the paint to form oxides of carbon and water vapour. In landfill, the notifiedpolymer will be present as high molecular weight solids which will be neither bioavailable nor mobile.Therefore, based on its assumed low hazard and assessed use pattern, the notified polymer is notconsidered to pose an unacceptable risk to the environment."

HUMAN HEALTH RISK ASSESSMENTThe notified polymer meets the PLC criteria and is therefore assumed to be of low hazard. This issupported by tests submitted on the fol lowing toxicological endpoints.Endpoint Result EffectsObserved? Test GuidelineRat, acute oral LD50 > 2000 mg/kgbw no OECD TG 401Rabbit, skin irritation non-irritating no OECD TG 404Skin sensitisation - non-adjuvant test no evidence ofsensitisation no OECD TG 406 (Maximisationtest)All results were indicative of low hazard.Although not considered in this risk assessment, NICNAS notes that the notified polymer containsresidual monomers that are classified as hazardous according to the Globally Harmonised System forthe Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS), as adopted for industrial chemicals in Australia .These are not present in the notified polymer as introduced above the cut off concentrations forclassification.7. ENVIRONMENTAL RISK ASSESSMENTThe notified polymer will be imported neat, in solid form , and will not be reformulated in Australia.Therefore, no environmental release is expected from manufacture or reformulation in Austr alia. Anyimport container residue or spills of the notified polymer will be contained and disposed to landfill in accordance with local regulations.During use, the notified polymer will be pumped directly into drilling wells. The notifier has indicatedthat after the completion of drilling operations, the drilling mud containing the notified polymer willbe retrieved and a portion will be reused following reconditioning. Approximately 75% of the notifiedpolymer in the drilling mud will be reused. The remaining 25% of the notified polymer in the drillingmud will be disposed in accordance with local regulations. Solids generated during substratereconditioning will be disposed to landfill.The results from ecotoxicological investigations conducted on the notified polymer are summarised inthe table below.Endpoint Result Assessment ConclusionDaphnia ToxicityAcartia tonsa (48 hours) NOEL = 1800 mg/L (WAF*) Not harmfulAlgal ToxicitySkeletonema costatum (72 hours) NOE rL = 1000 mg/L (WAF*) Not harmfulSediment Dwelling OrganismToxicityCorophium volutator (10 days) NOEC = 1431.1 mg/kg (dry wt) Not harmful* WAF: Water Accommodated FractionMarch 2015 NICNASPUBLIC REPORT: PLC/ 1250 Page 6 of 6 All results were indicative of low hazard. Based on the above endpoints, the notified polymer is notconsidered to be harmful to fish, daphnids, and algae up to the limit of its water solubility. Thenotified polymer is also not harmful to sediment dwelli ng organisms. Based on the toxicity to aquaticbiota, the notified polymer is not classified under the Globally Harmonised System of Classificationand Labelling of Chemicals (GHS; United Nations, 2009) on acute and chronic bases.The notified polymer is not expected to be readily biodegradable (6% in 28 days). It is also notexpected to cross biological membranes due to its high molecular weight and low water solubility, andis therefore not expected to bioaccumulate. In landfill, the notified polymer is expected to eventuallydegrade via abiotic and biotic pathways to form water and oxides of carbon.A predicted environmental concentration (PEC) has not been calculated since no significant release ofthe notified polymer to the aquatic compartment is exp ected from the reported usage pattern.A Predicted No -Effect Concentration (PNEC) for the aquatic compartment has not been calculatedsince the notified polymer is not harmful to aquatic organisms up to the limit of its water solubility.The Risk Quotien t (RQ = PEC/PNEC) has not been calculated since the PEC and PNEC have not beencalculated. The notified polymer is not harmful up to the limit of its water solubility and no significantrelease to the aquatic compartment is anticipated.Therefore, based on its assumed low hazard, the notified polymer is not considered to pose anunreasonable risk to the environment."

The notified polymer will be used in injectionmoulding for the ma nufacture of plastic articles containing the notified polymer at 5- 100%concentration. The finished products will have end use in, for example, the electrical and automotiveindustries. Finished products containing the notified polymer may also have some transient foodcontact (for example, plastic food covers ).6. HUMAN HEALTH RISK ASSESSMENTThe notified polymer meets the PLC criteria and is therefore assumed to be of low hazard. This issupported by tests submitted on the fol lowing toxicological endpoints.Endpoint Result EffectsObserved? Test GuidelineRat, acute oral LD50 > 2000 mg/kgbw no OECD TG 42 5Genotoxicity - bacterialreverse mutation non mutagenic no OECD TG 471All results were indicative of low hazard.The notified polymer will not be used for food packaging but may have some transient food contactwhen used, for example, in plastic food covers. Given the high molecular weight (> 10,000 Da) andlow percentage (< 1%) of low mo lecular weight species (< 1000 Da), the notified polymer is notexpected to migrate into food. Furthermore the notified polymer is listed as an acceptable food contactsubstance on the US FDA’s Inventory of Effective Food Contact Substance Notifications.Although not considered in this risk assessment, NICNAS notes that the notified polymer containsresidual monomers that are classified as hazardous according to the Globally Harmonised System forthe Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS ), as adopted for industrial chemicals in Australia .These are not present in the notified polymer as introduced above the cut off concentrations forclassification.The risk of the notified polymer to occupational and public health is not considered to be unreasonablegiven the assumed low hazard and the assessed use pattern.7. ENVIRONMENTAL RISK ASSESSMENTNo ecotoxicological data were submitted. Polymers without significant ionic functionality aregenerally of low concern to the environment.The notified polyme r will be imported neat, in a solid form , to be compounded with other resins andadditives in a melt processing operation. If reformulation of the notified polymer occurs, it will takeplace at the point of extrusion of the molten plastic. Spills during the manufacturing of injectionmoulded arti cles are expected to be collected and reused. Most of the notified polymer will bephysically incorporated within the inert polymer matrix.At the end of their useful life, articles containing the notified polymer are expected to be disposed of to landfil l. All wastes including import container residues and empty containers are expected to bedisposed of to landfill. Based on its high molecular weight and chemical structure, the notified polymer is not expected to be readily biodegradable. In landfill, the notified polymer is bound within apolymer matrix and is not expected to be bioavailable or mobile. Due to its high molecular weight and low solubility, the notified polymer is not expected to cross biological membranes and is, therefore, March 2015 NICNASPUBLIC REPORT: PLC/ 1257 Page 6 of 6 not expected to bioaccumulate. It is expected to eventually degrade by biotic and abiotic processes inlandfill to form water and oxides of carbon and nitrogen.Therefore, based on its assumed low hazard and reported use pattern, the notified polymer is not considered to pose an unreasonable risk to the environment."

It will beimported into Australia a s pellets in sealed containers at 100% concentration . The finished plasticarticles will contain the notified polymer at < 60% concentration. The notified polymer is not intendedfor use in food packaging applications.6. HUMAN HEALTH RISK ASSESSMENTNo toxicological data were submitted. The notified polymer meets the PLC criteria and can thereforebe considered to be of low hazard. The risk of the notified polymer to occupational and public healthis not considered to be unreasonable given the assumed low hazard and the assessed use pattern.7. ENVIRONMENTAL RISK ASSESSMENTNo ecotoxicological data were submitted. Polymers without significant ionic functionality aregenerally of low concern to the environment.The majority of the notified polymer will be used in the manufacture of plastic articles by injectionmoulding or extrusion, and will be physically incorporated within the inert polymer matrix. At the endof their useful life, articles containing the notif ied polymer are expected to be disposed of to landfill.Release of the notified polymer to the aquatic environment is not expected during reformulation or article manufacturing as residues in equipment washings are expected to be collected and disposed ofto landfill. All wastes, import container residues and empty containers are expected to be disposed of January 2014 NICNASPUBLIC REPORT: PLC/ 1173 Page 5 of 5 to landfill. Based on its high molecular weight and chemical structure, the notified polymer is notexpected to be readily biodegradable. In landfill, th e notified polymer is bound within a polymermatrix and is not expected to be bioavailable or mobile. Due to its high molecular weight, the notified polymer is not expected to cross biological membranes and it is therefore not expected to bioaccumulate. It is expected to eventually degrade by biotic and abiotic processes in landfill to formwater and oxides of carbon and nitrogen. Therefore, based on its assumed low hazard and assessed usepattern, the notified polymer is not considered to pose an unreasona ble risk to the environment."

The d rums will be transported from the wharf tothe Sunshine North factory by road.Reformulation/manufacture processesThe notified polymer, as the imported solution containing up to 80% w/w polymer in organic solvent,will be used in the formulation of a water -based industrial coating.After arriving at the Akzo Nobel site, the palletised drums have raw material/safety labels affixed andwill be stored in an approved bunded storage area. The palletised, coded drums will be taken by fork -lift to the fact ory for finished coating formulation . During coating formulation , the notified polymerwill be blended with other polymers, additives, organic solvents and water to produce a water -basedemulsion containing typically 3% of the notified polymer. The finishe d emulsion containing thenotified polymer will be stored in bulk in stainless steel tanks in a bunded tank farm.UseThe only use of the notified polymer will be as a curing component of an industrial automotive paintprimer.The finished emulsion containing the notified polymer will be transported by road from themanufacturing site to a car manufacturer in bulk tankers. At the customer site the finished emulsionwill be stored in bulk tanks until it is required at which time it will be pumped into the application tankand blended with pigment pastes and water to make the primer; final concentration of notified polymeris typically 1.2%. Car bodies will be coated with the primer by a dipping process. Once coating hasoccurred t he car bodies will be rinsed with water to remove excess primer. The primer will be cured onthe car by baking.6. HUMAN HEALTH IMPLICATIONSJuly 2013 NICNASPUBLIC REPORT: SAPLC/151 Page 7 of 86.1. Exposure AssessmentOCCUPATIONAL EXPOSUREThe notified polymer will be handled as a solution in organic solvent at up to 80% concentrationduring transport and reformulation and up to 3% concentration as a water emulsion during paintapplication.During transport and storage, workers are unlikely to be exposed to the notified polymer except whenpackaging (steel drums) is accidently breached.Potential occupational exposure to the notified polymer during reformulation is prevented by virtue ofsafeguards in place for handling such materials. These safeguards include isolation of the reformulationprocess, engineering controls such as local exhaust ventilation, safe working practices according tostandard operating procedures and personal protective equipment (gloves, overalls, goggles).Potential occupational exposure to the notified polymer during paint application is prevented by virtueof the dipping process and safeguards in place for other hazardous ingredients in the notified polymerpaint dispersion. These safeguards include isolation of the process, engineering controls such as localexhaust ventilation, safe working practices according to standard operating procedures and personalprotective equipment (gloves, overalls, goggles and respirators).PUBLIC EXPOSUREThe notified polymer is intended only for use in industry and as such public exposure to the notifiedpolymer is not expected. Also, once applied (as a component in paint) to car bodies, the notifiedpolymer will be cured into an inert matrix and hence will not be available for exposure.6.2. Toxicological Hazard CharacterisationNo toxicological data were submitted. The notified polymer meets the PLC criteria and can thereforebe considered to be of low hazard.6.3. Human Health Risk AssessmentOCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETYThe OHS risk presented by the notified polymer is expected to be low, based on the assumed lowhazard of the notified polymer as well as the engineering controls and personal protective equipmentused by workers to minimis e exposure.PUBLIC HEALTHThe notified polymer will not be sold to the public. The paint containing the notified polymer will beused by industrial applicators. Once the polymer is applied and cured it will be contained in an inertmatrix, and hence will not be bioavailable for exposure. The risk to the public from exposure to thenotified polymer is considered to be low.7. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPLICATIONSJuly 2013 NICNASPUBLIC REPORT: SAPLC/151 Page 8 of 87.1. Exposure AssessmentENVIRONMENTAL RELEASEThe notified polymer is not expected to be released directly to the environment during transport or atthe reformulation site. Reformulation to the finished product will occur in a closed vessel and there islimited scope for accidental spillage to occur during this process. Minimal quantities of the notifiedpolymer may be released as residue on filters, vessel cleaning residues and quality control sampleresidue during t he reformulation process. These residues will be disposed of to landfill or thermallydecomposed. Empty drums containing residues (estimated to be 100 kg notified polymer per annum)are expected to be sent to licensed drum reconditioners where the residual notified polymer may becollected for disposal to landfill or be thermally decomposed.The application process should fully contain the notified polymer. Any excess primer is expected to bewashed off the car bodies and recycled into the dipping tank. An y waste water containing residues ofthe notified polymer from the dipping tank is expected to be treated at on site waste water treatmentplants (WWTP). A small fraction of the annual imported volume of the notified polymer is likely to bereleased to th e public sewer as residues not captured by the WWTP. In sewage treatment plants (STP),the notified polymer is expected to be removed by up to 90% through adsorption to sludge during STPprocesses. Sludge containing the notified polymer is likely to be col lected for disposal to landfill ormay be used for soil remediation.Discarded end use articles containing the notified polymer within the cured paint film will be disposedto landfill, or recycled for metals reclamation which will entail thermal decompo sition of the notifiedpolymer to form water and oxides of carbon and nitrogen.ENVIRONMENTAL FATEThe waste generated as described above will be ultimately disposed of to landfill or thermallydecomposed. In landfill, the notified polymer will be present as a cured solid film and will be neitherbioavailable nor mobile. The uncured polymer is not expected to cross biological membranes, due tothe high molecular weight, and is not expected to bioaccumulate. The notified polymer will slowlydegrade i n landfill by biotic and abiotic processes to form water and oxides of carbon and nitrogen.Therefore based on the low assumed hazard to aquatic organisms and low potential for aquaticexposure, the notified polymer is not expected to pose an unreasonable risk to the environment when itis used as proposed.7.2. Environmental Hazard CharacterisationNo ecotoxicological data were submitted. PLCs without significant ionic functionality are of lowconcern to the aquatic environment.7.3. Environmental Risk AssessmentBased on the low hazard and assessed use pattern, the notified polymer is not considered to pose anunreasonable risk to the environment."

The notified polyme r will be used as a hair fixative in leave- on hairstylingproducts, such as hair sprays, mousses and gels, at ≤5% concentration.6. HUMAN HEALTH RISK ASSESSMENTThe notified polymer meets the P LC criteria and is therefore assumed to be of low hazard. This i ssupported by tests submitted on the following toxicological endpoints , which were conducted on thenotified polymer (as imported, at <50% concentration) or analogue polymer .Endpoint Result Effects Observed? Test Guideline1. Rat, acute oral(1) LD50 >5000 mg/kg bw no OECD TG 4252. Rat, acute dermal(1) LD50 >5000 mg/kg bw no OECD TG 4024.

Genotoxicity - bacterialreverse mutation(1) non mutagenic No OECD TG 471(1) Study conducted on the imported product containing <50% notified polymer.(2) Study conducted on an analogue of the notified polymer .(3) NOAEL determined by the study authors.(4) Effects discussed in text below.The imported product containing the notified polymer (at <50% concentration) was determined to beslightly irritating to the skin and eyes of rabbits. However, the effects observed in the skin and eyeirritation studies did not warrant classification of th e test substance as an irritant.There were no mortalities in a 90- day repeat dose inhalation study conducted on an analogue of thenotified polymer (mean respirable fractions of the aerosols ranged from 77- 89%; the water solubilityof the analogue polyme r is not known) . Treatment -related effects were limited to the high (73.2mg/m3) and mid (7.3 mg/m3) dose groups, though for those effects observed in the mid dose group,they were deemed by the study authors not to be adverse. Treatment related effects included increasedlung weight, changes in the white blood cell parameters, increases in alveolar macrophages(accompanied by neutrophils in the high dose group) and slight hyperplasia of the mediastinal lymphnodes. Following a 14-week recovery period, the effects noted in the lungs of the animals of the highdose group included increased alveolar macrophages, minimal alveolitis and minimal bronchiolar andalveolar epithelial hyperplasia. In addition, it was noted that the medias tinal lymph nodes were lessenlarged/hyperplastic then those examined at the completion of the exposure period. The study authorsnote that the changes observed suggest an impairment of macrophage clearance.The significance of these lung -overload type findings to the notified polymer is uncertain. However,based on this study and given that high molecular weight polymers (Mn >10,000 Da, particularly January 2012 NICNASPUBLIC REPORT: PLC/1002 Page 6 of 6 polymers with low water solubility) do present a concern for potential lung damage followingrespiration o f particles, the possibility of similar lung overloa ding effects cannot be excluded if there isinhalation exposure to aerosols with particle sizes in the respirable range.The notified polymer is intended to be used in a range of hairstyling products at ≤5% concentration,including aerosol hair sprays. T he primary risk to human health associated with use of productscontaining the notified polymer will be due to the potential for lung overloading effects followinginhalation of aerosols from hairspray s. The potential for the formation of respirable particles isconsidered to be lower for pump hairsprays and inhalation exposure is not expected during use of non-spray products.The water solubility of the notified polymer is reported to vary with pH and this is likely to affect thepotential for lung overloading. I f the notified polymer is inhaled at low levels and/or infrequentl y, it islikely to be cleared from the lungs. However, high level and/or frequent exposure may result in lungoverloading effec ts, though the level of exposure in humans that would result in these effects and theseverity of these effects is uncertain . The degree of exposure of workers (namely, hairdressers) and thepublic to hairsprays containing the polymer is likely to vary gre atly depending on the amount andfrequency of individual application and the spray environment (e.g. room size and degree ofventilation).Therefore , the risk to the health of workers and the public from use of the notified polymer inhairstyling product s at ≤5% concentration is not considered to be unreasonable provided that measuresto minimise exposure during aerosol spray applications are in place. Such measures include that usersbe directed to only apply hairsprays in well ventilated areas and to av oid inhalation of the spraycontents.ENVIRONMENTAL RISK ASSESSMENTNo ecotoxicological data were submitted. However, the notified polymer is an anionic polymer, towhich algae is expected to be the most sensitive species. The mode of toxic action is ov er-chelation ofnutrient elements needed by algae for growth. The highest toxicity is when the acid is on alternatingcarbons of the polymer backbone, which may apply to the notified polymer. However, the toxicity ofthe notified polymer to algae is likely to be reduced due to the pendant position of the acid groups anddilution of the chelating monomer with non- chelating monomers. In addition, the toxicity to algae islikely to be further reduced due to the presence of calcium ions in environmental waters, which willbind to the functional groups.The majority of the notified polymer will be released to sewage treatment plants, although up to 3% isexpected to be disposed of to landfill as residues in import and end- use cosmetic containers. Under aworst case scenario it will be assumed that 100 % of the notified polymer will be washed into sewers.Assuming 75% of the notified polymer will be removed via absorption to sludge in the sewagetreatment plant, the resultant predicted environmental concentration (PEC) in sewage effluent on anationwide basis is estimated as 4.54 µg/L [PECriver = 82.19 kg notified polymer/day ÷(200 L/person/day × 22.613 million people) × 1 (dilution factor)]. The PEC is well below the EC50 foralgae of the most toxic anionic polym ers (EC 50 >1 mg/L).The notified polymer is not expected to cross biological membranes due to its high molecular weightand it is therefore not expected to bioaccumulate. It is expected to eventually degrade by abiotic andbiotic processes to form water and oxides of carbon.Based on its assumed low hazard and assessed use pattern, the notified polymer is not considered topose an unreasonable risk to the environment."

INTRODUCTION AND USE INFORMATIONMaximum Introduction Volume of Notified Chemical (100%) Over Next 5 YearsYear 1 2 3 4 5Tonnes 500-1000 1000 -2100 1000 -2100 1000 -2100 1000 -2100UseThe notified polymer will not be imported into Australia. The notified polymer will be manufacturedat the Clayton, Victoria PPG site as a polymer solution containing the polymer at 50- 70% in organicsolvent .The solution containing the notified poly mer will be poured from 200 L drums into 5000 L capacitysteel vessels. Other batch ingredients will b e added and mixing will occur at room temperature. Duringformulation of the paint , workers will manually weigh and transfer the polymer solution to the m ixingvessels. The final product (containing < 30% notified polymer) will then be piped to 200 L steel drumsand warehoused at the Clayton site until distributed to customers .The notified polymer within the finished products will be used as a compone nt of coil coatings at< 30%, forming part of the binder in the coatings. The coil coatings will be used for industrial exteriorroofing and walling and will be applied by industrial coil coating companies only. The application willbe done by rollers attached to an automated application unit located in a ventilated room.The notified polymer is intended for use only by trained operators in industrial roller coating facilitiesand will not be sold to the public. Once the polymer is applied and cured it will b e contained within aninert matrix, and hence will not be bioavailable for exposure.6. HUMAN HEALTH RISK ASSESSMENTNo toxicological data were submitted. The notified polymer meets the PLC criteria and is thereforeassumed to be of low hazard. The risk of the notified polymer to occupational and public health is notconsidered to be unreasonable given the assumed low hazard and the assessed use pattern.7. ENVIRONMENTAL RISK ASSESSMENT7.1. Exposure AssessmentENVIRONMENTAL RELEASEThe notified polymer will be manufactured as part of a formulation at the PPG site in Clayton,Victoria. The formulation will be processed into finished industrial coatings for industrial coil coatingcompanies.There is potential for the release of the notified polymer during manuf acturing, transport,reformulation, application, equipment cleaning and in the event of an accidental spill. It is estimatedthat up to 3% of the total volume of the notified polymer will be released from cleaning of equipment (< 1%) and residues in contai ner (2%). These wastes are expected to be collected, treated and disposedof to landfill in accordance with local government regulations. As the notified polymer will be used in industrial settings, it is expected that no waste containing the notified poly mer will enter the seweragesystem or natural waterways.Once cured, the notified polymer is expected to be bound in an inert paint matrix and not available fordirect release to the environment. The coated metal substrate containing the notified polymer isexpected to be thermally decomposed during metal recycling or disposed of to landfill in accordancewith local government regulations at the end of its useful life. Therefore, release of the notified May 2018 NICNASPUBLIC REPORT: SAPLC/ 203 Page 6 of 6 polymer from the assessed use pattern is not expected to lead to ecotoxicologically significantconcentrations in the aquatic environment.ENVIRONMENTAL FATENo studies on the environmental fate of the notified polymer have been provided. Most of the notifiedpolymer is expected to share the fate of the ar ticles on which it was applied, to be either recycled formetal reclamation or disposed of to landfill at the end of their useful life. A small proportion of the notified polymer may remain as residue in empty containers and be generated from equipmentcleaning. These wastes are expected to be cured and disposed of to landfill along with the containersor adsorbents in accordance with local government regulations. During metal reclamation, the notified polymer will thermally decompose to form water vapour a nd oxides of carbon. In landfill, the notifiedpolymer will be present as cured solids and will be neither bioavailable nor mobile. The notified polymer is not expected to bioaccumulate due to its high molecular weight. The notified polymer inlandfill is expected to eventually degrade via biotic and abiotic processes to form water and oxides ofcarbon.7.2. Environmental Hazard CharacterisationNo ecotoxicological data for the notified polymer were submitted. Anionic polymers are generally oflow toxicity to fish and daphnia, however they are known to be moderately toxic to algae. The modeof toxic action is over -chelation of nutrient elements needed by algae for growth. The highest toxicityis when the acid is on alternating carbons of the polymer backbone, l eading to chelation of essentialnutrients. This is not expected to apply to the notified polymer and it is therefore not considered to bean over -chelation hazard to algae.7.1. Environmental Risk AssessmentBased on its assumed low hazard and the assessed u se pattern, the notified polymer is not consideredto pose an unreasonable risk to the aquatic environment."
