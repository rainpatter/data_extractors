The origin of the fluorocarbons is strongly suspected to be anthropogenic, and results from these studies have led major fluorocarbon manufacturer (3M) to cease production of these compounds (C & EN, 2001). Research funded by 3M found fluorinated compounds in human blood and animal tissue in parts of the world where these are not manufactured (Moody and Field, 2000; Environmental Science and Technology/News, 2000). Laboratory toxicity studies in rats and primates has shown that perfluorinated compounds can cause death in adult monkeys and rat offspring. In addition, the US EPA have stated “This widespread presence, persistence and bioaccumulation potential and the reproductive and subchronic toxicity of the chemical raises concerns for potential adverse effects on people and wildlife” (Chemical Regulation Observer, 2000).","No biodegradation data was provided, but it is probable that the hydrocarbon portions of the 
polymer will ultimately biodegrade and be slowly mineralised to water and oxides of carbon 
and nitrogen. However, the fluorocarbon portion is unlikely to be susceptible to 
biodegradation (Remde and Debus, 1996) in view of the electronegativity of fluorine and the 
great strength of the carbon-fluorine bond. Perfluorocarbons are more thermally stable than 
their corresponding hydrocarbon analogues. In particular, perfluorocarboxylic acids and 
perfluoroalkane sulfonic acids are considered the most thermally stable fluorinated 
surfactants. In addition to thermal stability, perfluorinated hydrocarbons are stable against 
degradation by acids, bases, oxidants and reductants (Moody, 2000). Fluorinated carboxylic 
acids can undergo hydrolytic defluorination, reductive defluorination, and decarboxylation. 
To date, however, significant defluorination has only been observed for hydrolytic attack of"

This report also indicates that around 86% of oil changes take place in specialised automotive service centres, where old oil drained from crankcases is disposed of responsibly (e.g. oil recycling or incineration). Assuming this is the case, negligible release of the notified polymer should result from these professional activities. The remaining 14% of oil is removed by DIY consumers.

No significant skin irritation effects were observed in the in vitro study at 68%. One reason for the difference may be the scope of the in vitro protocol, which covers the initial step of the inflammatory cascade that occurs during irritation in vivo (OECD, 2010), but does not measure persistence of the irritation effects, such as scaling. It is also noted that the test substance was tested as a solid in the in vitro study, and the very low irritation scores (similar to those of the negative control), are inconsistent with the erythema and oedema seen in the in vivo study and the local irritation effects observed in the acute dermal toxicity study in rats where irritation effects including slight erythema, oedema and maculated crusts were observed.

In environments where volatilisation to the atmosphere is not able to occur (eg. deep waters, groundwater, subsoils), the notified chemical is expected to be relatively persistent. It is not readily biodegradable but will likely biodegrade over time as in biodegradability tests the notified chemical attained 38% degradation after 28 days and it would likely have degraded further with more time. The notified chemical will not readily hydrolyse in natural waters at environmentally relevant pH values, but in alkaline waters (eg pH 9 or greater) hydrolysis may be a significant degradation process (half life 13 days). It is moderately soluble in water (11.5 mg/L; Mensink et al., 1995) and has a density similar to water, but it has a potential to adsorb to particulate organic material and therefore accumulate in sediments due to this sorption and settlement. It is not expected to be very mobile in soils and groundwater due to its high sorption potential (log Koc 3.18) and moderate water solubility. With a log Kow of 4.48 and calculated bioconcentration factor (BCF) range of 562 (Meylan & Howard, 2000) to 1280 (Veith et al., 1979), the notified chemical has the potential to bioconcentrate in exposed aquatic organisms; however, no test data were available on depuration rates or actual bioaccumulated residues.",

NA649,PA (United States Environmental Protection Agency) (1996) Series 850-Ecological Effects Test Guidelines (draft) OPPTS 850.1730: Fish BCF.,"Brominated flame retardants (eg. pentabrominated diphenyl ether or Penta-BDE) are widely used globally in the manufacture of flexible polyurethane foam products (content 5-30% by weight). However, health and environmental concerns due to the occurrence of this chemical in the environment and people have led to the banning/disuse of several compounds in some countries. As indicated by the notifier, a market for chemicals such as the notified chemical has developed. However, the notified chemical raises similar environmental concerns as other brominated flame retardants with similar use pattern as it may also be released to the environment through similar routes. The limited information available for the notified chemical indicates that it is very toxic to aquatic organisms, but is not persistent (based on an aquatic sediment test) and not bioaccumulative. If released into the environment or landfill, the notified chemical is likely to degrade over time, and is most likely to partition to sediments, soils and organic carbon (Log Koc >4.46). It is unlikely to be mobile in soils/sediments and is unlikely to percolate and affect groundwater. Due to its low vapour pressure (1.3X10-7 kPa at 25oC), volatilisation to the atmosphere is unlikely to be a significant migration pathway. With an estimated Henry’s Law Constant of ~3.5X10-2 Pa.m3/mole, the notified chemical is essentially non-volatile from waters. PBT Profiler (USEPA, 2004) indicates that the notifier chemical is estimated to have a half life in air of 0.75 days. Within a wastewater treatment plant or sewerage system, the notified chemical is likely to partition to suspended particulates and sludge and degrade over time (USEPA, 2004). Site-specific treatment processes will determine the quantity collect as sludge or released with effluent. Due to its low persistence, the notified chemical is unlikely to enter a terrestrial environment (eg. soils) where sewage sludge or effluent is collected and reused as biosolids or irrigation water, respectively.",

The origin of the fluorocarbons is strongly suspected to be anthropogenic, and results from these studies have led a major fluorocarbon manufacturer (3M) to cease production of these compounds (Tullo, 2001). Research funded by 3M found fluorinated compounds in human blood and animal tissue in parts of the world where these are not manufactured (Moody and Field, 2000; Environmental Science and Technology/News, 2000). However, unlike perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS, an ingredient of a soon-to-be-discontinued oil and water repellent), which has been found at elevated levels in the tissues of organisms in remote marine regions well removed from major human activity, significant tissue concentrations of perfluorooctanoic acid seem to be far less widespread (Giesy and Kannan, 2001). Laboratory toxicity studies in rats and primates has shown that perfluorinated compounds can cause death in adult monkeys and rat offspring (Renner, 2001). In addition, the US EPA have stated “This widespread presence, persistence and bioaccumulation potential and the reproductive and subchronic toxicity of the chemical (PFOS) raises concerns for potential adverse effects on people and wildlife” (Chemical Regulation Reporter, 2000).","Geisy JP and Kannan K (2001) Global Distribution of Perfluoroocatne Sulfonate in

The results indicate the substance is readily biodegradable under the conditions of the test. This suggests that the perfluorinated part of the molecule degrades rapidly. However,  Remde and Debus (2) were not able to establish the fate of fluorinated moieties in the biodegradation of three different fluorinated surfactants investigated. They concluded that in all cases the formation of a highly fluorinated water insoluble fragment with unknown toxicity could not be ruled out (even when one was readily degraded), and it is likely that the fluorocarbon portion will be persistent.","The notified chemical consists of a mixture of congeners with varying length of 
perfluoroalkyl chains (C4-8). The potential for bioaccumulation of these congeners

bioaccumulation. However, the high water solubility (and consequential likely low 
partition coefficient) and ionic nature of the chemical would indicate that the 
chemical is unlikely to bioaccumulate (3)"

Surface-active agents cause skin irritation by reacting with skin proteins and disrupting lipids in the stratum corneum, leading to skin permeability and eventually damage to deeper epidermal or dermal layers (Walker et al, 2004). In addition, the notified chemical contains at least two structural alerts for skin irritation/corrosion potential (Hulzebos et al, 2004). All of these predictions were found to be accurate in the skin irritation study, where the notified chemical was corrosive and/or caused burns, after either 3 minutes or 4 hours of skin contact. Evidence of skin irritation was also observed in the acute dermal toxicity study, where persistent erythema and necrosis were observed at skin application sites. Similar effects were observed for Analogue 2, suggesting a similar mode of action for the two structurally related chemicals (IUCLID, 2006).

Research found fluorinated compounds in human blood and animal tissue in parts of the world where these are not manufactured (Environmental Science and Technology/News, 2000). Laboratory toxicity studies in rats and primates showed that such compounds can cause death in adult monkeys and rat offspring. In addition, the US EPA have stated “This widespread presence, persistence and bioaccumulation potential and the reproductive and subchronic toxicity of the chemical raises concerns for potential adverse effects on people and wildlife” (Chemical Regulation Observer, 2000).","No biodegradation data was provided, but it is probable that the hydrocarbon portions of the 
polymer will ultimately biodegrade and slowly mineralise to water and oxides of carbon and 
nitrogen. However, the fluorocarbon portion is unlikely to be susceptible to biodegradation 
(Remde and Debus, 1996) in view of the electronegativity of fluorine and the great strength 
of the carbon-fluorine bond. Perfluorocarbons are more thermally stable than their 
corresponding hydrocarbon analogues. In particular, perfluorocarboxylic acids and 
perfluoroalkane sulfonic acids are considered the most thermally stable fluorinated 
surfactants. In addition to thermal stability, perfluorinated hydrocarbons are stable against 
degradation by acids, bases, oxidants and reductants (Moody, 2000). Fluorinated carboxylic 
acids can undergo hydrolytic defluorination, reductive defluorination, and decarboxylation. 
To date, however, significant defluorination has only been observed for hydrolytic attack of 
monofluorinated carboxylic acids, and compounds of more than one fluorine atom per carbon 
atom are generally recalcitrant (Blake, 1997). The notified polymer has a nominal fluorine 
content of approximately 34% and studies have shown that fluorinated compounds with a 
fluoride content in the order of 50% will not biodegrade over a period of 60 days (Remde and 
Debus, 1996). Further, fluorocarbons have little affinity for either water or organic phases 
and ultimately will concentrate near the surface of water bodies, for example, when released 
in sewage treatment plant effluent. Here they are likely to degrade by abiotic cleavage, with 
assistance from UV radiation, into smaller fluorocarbon species, which will be volatile and 
partition into the atmosphere. Here further reaction with hydroxyl radicals and action by UV 
radiation is expected to lead to degradation to hydrogen fluoride and precipitation to the 
surface in rain. However, the fluorocarbon species may not take part in the destruction of the 
ozone layer, as is typical of chlorofluorocarbons."

SN11,PA (1995) Reregistration Eligibility Decision Facts – Alkyl imidazoline.,"No test data on biodegradation under either aerobic or anaerobic conditions were supplied, and such data would have been useful in assessing the likely persistence of the chemical once released to the environment. However, the chemical structure of the compound indicates that it does not contain groups known to be highly refractory to biodegradation, although biodegradation is likely to be a slow process.  It is expected that under aerobic conditions the compound will be ultimately mineralised to water, oxides of carbon (carbonates) and oxides of nitrogen, while in anaerobic environments the primary degradation products would be methane, oxides of carbon and ammonia.  The chemical has a cationic residue, and consequently is expected to interact strongly with negatively charged colloidal material in the environment. Most natural waters contain colloidal humic material which is negatively charged as a consequence of its high content of carboxylate groups, and so any notified chemical released to the water compartment will become associated with colloidal material and would eventually become assimilated into bottom sediments and would be slowly degraded in sludge and bottom sediments.",
